he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it  
and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again  
" she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter  
there are few people in england , i suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste  
by you , i was properly humbled  
chapter i  
she was overpowered by shame and vexation  
but he is an ugly fellow ! i am glad he is gone  
and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it  
the promised letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have prompted  
a flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation  
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire  
his brother in law , mr hurst , merely looked the gentleman  
for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom  
i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr darcy ' s regard  
he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you  
till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance  
but darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious  
" " you are uniformly charming ! " cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry  
it settled the matter  
mrs wickham ! how well it sounds  
it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate  
" it will then be early enough for expectation  
" no one made any reply  
and she could not help remembering what charlotte ' s opinion had always been  
but it must be done soon  
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better  
" " has your governess left you ? " " we never had any governess  
she really rejoiced at it  
i shall offer to pay him to morrow  
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard , his claims on mr darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed  
i am most seriously displeased  
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it  
pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it  
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic  
it was then disclosed in the following manner  
such i was , from eight to eight and twenty  
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family  
" " removed ! " cried bingley  
and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably  
and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved  
" with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content  
they repulsed every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins , who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests  
and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her  
when a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty  
" " indeed you are mistaken  
" the idea of mr collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : " my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish  
i must confess myself surprised by your application  
i should infinitely prefer a book  
but her conclusion was false  
while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them  
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible  
his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased  
it is useless to talk of it  
the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman like set , and the best of them were of the present party  
bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn  
we may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon  
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday  
she answered him with cold civility  
my father was not only fond of this young man ' s society , whose manners were always engaging  
but the things should be ordered immediately  
" " i am , " said he , with a firm voice  
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner  
in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london

the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before  
for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? " " oh ! " cried elizabeth , " i am excessively diverted  
" oh ! my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately  
" why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? " she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure  
when it was no longer likely they should meet  
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents  
" " did you go by the village of kympton ? " " i do not recollect that we did  
their reception from mr bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial  
and in her postscript it was added , that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well  
when her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication  
after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains  
it was mr collins ' s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened  
however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham  
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation  
miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed  
" this will not do , " said elizabeth  
the day of his and lydia ' s departure soon came , and mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth  
till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , " you , who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right  
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr bingley and jane , she had never doubted  
come into my room  
an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure  
elizabeth was in agonies  
" " why will you think so ? it must be his own doing  
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation  
i was uncomfortable enough  
nothing of the past was recollected with pain  
but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters  
kitty , run down and order the carriage  
my dear hill , have you heard the good news ? miss lydia is going to be married  
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that she would not give into it  
what an agreeable man sir william is , mr bingley is not he ? so much the man of fashion ! so genteel and so easy ! he has always something to say to every body  
i am not qualified to form one  
" " can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? " " yes  
miss bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure  
but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day  
for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming  
sir william had been delighted with him  
the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure  
" good heaven ! what is to become of us ! what are we to do ! " would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe  
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham ' s desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well  
" " it was a subject which they could not mention before me  
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty  
" it has been a very agreeable day , " said miss bennet to elizabeth  
but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure  
she had ventured only one glance at darcy  
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece  
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable  
we acted with the best intentions  
i dare say the lace upon mrs hurst ' s gown " here she was interrupted again  
but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received  
perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones  
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance  
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here  
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections  
" and gravely glancing at mr darcy , " there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with 'keep your breath to cool your porridge ,' and i shall keep mine to swell my song  
how he lived i know not  
you will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that mr wickham ' s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be  
mr darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister  
" " and men take care that they should  
my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped  
but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again  
their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy ' s  
he was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire  
mrs gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder  
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room  
but to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult  
for forty years , he produced and distributed project gutenberg tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support  
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above  
first of all , he asked miss lucas  
but , lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not  
and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte ' s dying an old maid  
to mrs gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers  
" it is nothing in comparison of rosings , my lady , i dare say  
and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement  
" i , who have prided myself on my discernment ! i , who have valued myself on my abilities ! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust  
the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise  
she declared her resolution  
elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion  
is not it so , mrs bennet ? " " yes , or i will never see her again  
i expected you to stay two months  
" and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you  
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together  
chapter xvi  
with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings  
but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better  
they will ruin your happiness  
unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg : <num> 
" " and what arts did he use to separate them ? " " he did not talk to me of his own arts , " said fitzwilliam smiling  
" " thank you , " said lydia , " for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry  
having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over  
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and i spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer  
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation , and always spending more than they ought  
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " mr darcy , i am a very selfish creature  
and though mrs collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as i have often told her , to come to rosings every day , and play on the piano forte in mrs jenkinson ' s room  
" " indeed ! " " yes the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift  
as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters  
but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister ' s absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized  
" what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia ! " she cried  
" can you come to morrow ? " yes , he had no engagement at all for to morrow  
chapter xv  
such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly  
her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank  
the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house  
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door  
it was a rational scheme to be sure ! but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine  
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ? they could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same  
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet  
hart was the originator of the project gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone  
this room was my late master ' s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then  
they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt  
i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings  
he owns it himself without disguise  
from their infancy , they have been intended for each other  
she went on  
" " i wish it may  
but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity  
they insist also on my seeing mr jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and head ache there is not much the matter with me  
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected  
the feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten  
and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies  
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes  
put them next to your great uncle the judge  
" " lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use  
" " i say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other  
and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce  
and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left meryton greatly in debt  
in pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered meryton  
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet ' s height , or rather taller  
his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity  
brother in law of wickham ! every kind of pride must revolt from the connection  
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used  
and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man  
and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement  
there can be no love in all this  
his sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion  
" you quite mistook mr darcy  
and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin  
" but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only  
of this she was perfectly unaware  
and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own  
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these  
" i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend  
" they were brightened by the exercise  
" " miss bennet i am shocked and astonished  
on the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in meryton , he dined with others of the officers at longbourn  
" it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened  
but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up  
all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister  
he has heartily forgiven me now  
but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended  
elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth  
thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together  
oh ! that abominable mr darcy ! my father ' s opinion of me does me the greatest honour  
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased  
i will try again  
but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent  
bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them  
if you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment  
thus , we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition  
" elizabeth ' s astonishment was beyond expression  
they are in the same profession , you know  
and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary  
you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me  
mr bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene  
they had frequently been staying with her in town  
" the period of expectation was now doubled  
" but how did he account for it ? " " it must have been his sister ' s doing  
i know not what to think  
nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been  
i need not explain myself farther  
" " certainly , my dear , nobody said there were  
and i am sure if i had been you , i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it  
and by that means , as i told lady catherine myself one day , has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament  
" oh ! mr collins ! " " my dear madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point  
had she found jane in any apparent danger , mrs bennet would have been very miserable  
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side  
they are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain  
she had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ' s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance  
" with a stronger voice she soon added , " i have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself  
and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them  
and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner  
your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins , and i will never see you again if you do  
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement  
the miss webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your ' s  
with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round  
he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend  
happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over ! " " i wish i could say any thing to comfort you , " replied elizabeth  
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment  
but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her  
as yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness  
i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of  
" " perhaps i do  
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ' s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " ah ! jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman  
" " a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe  
mr bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before  
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an inmate of mr darcy ' s house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture  
" " this is the only point , i flatter myself , on which we do not agree  
" she times them ill  
mrs gardiner , who was several years younger than mrs bennet and mrs philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces  
though it was not put in as it ought to be  
unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept  
i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection  
" mr and mrs gardiner smiled  
and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself  
or at least it was impossible not to try for information  
pray go to see them , with sir william and maria  
" your ' s sincerely , &c  
no officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village  
the day passed most pleasantly away  
" " but you how are you ? " cried elizabeth  
the compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt  
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known  
her ladyship was highly incensed  
but we are none of us consistent  
your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know  
" " then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said mrs bennet  
her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables  
as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter  
" she then sat still five minutes longer  
elizabeth felt jane ' s pleasure  
and elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations' consent , there was still something to be wished for  
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh , i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters  
from the farther disadvantage of lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going  
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them  
" " i am not likely to leave kent for some time  
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject  
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly , to try to discover her  
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london  
elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome  
" how near it may be to mine , i cannot pretend to say  
i dare say i shall soon see them here  
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride  
" and when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " oh ! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop  
" i am , dear sir , &c  
" " oh ! but the gentlemen will have mr bingley ' s chaise to go to meryton  
steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her  
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece  
" my father and maria are to come to me in march , " added charlotte , " and i hope you will consent to be of the party  
mr darcy looked up  
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty  
" " all this she must possess , " added darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading  
" " i certainly shall not  
you know i always speak my mind , and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves  
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that  
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side  
" " my fingers , " said elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women ' s do  
miss bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps  
he meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it  
there was now employment for the whole party  
" with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did lydia , assisted by kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn  
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others  
" " well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right  
and thither also went mr wickham , undoubtedly by design  
chapter xi  
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character  
i cannot think of it without abhorrence  
yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week  
" if he does not come to me , then , " said she , " i shall give him up for ever  
" you began the evening well , charlotte , " said mrs bennet with civil self command to miss lucas  
" mr bingley followed his advice  
and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city  
she is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all  
" in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned  
it is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will think of us  
he then said , " i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly  
i have nothing to say against him  
i enquired after their brother , of course  
w  
but my dear lydia , i don't at all like your going such a way off  
but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine  
and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley ' s two sisters  
lydia , my love , ring the bell  
she was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place  
and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected  
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible  
mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world  
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet , with a polite congratulation  
elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly  
such was miss lucas ' s scheme  
and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch  
you could not make me happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so  
you know him too well to doubt the rest  
he has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister  
" repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare  
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment  
and i was convinced of her affection  
and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room  
i am sick of them all  
" " could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia ' s note to his wife ? " " he brought it with him for us to see  
mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy  
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost  
in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation  
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but mr darcy they had only seen at church  
it has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor  
she directly replied , " you need not be frightened  
i cannot blame myself for having done thus much  
and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance  
i cannot find out that i hate her at all , or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl  
oh ! why is not every body as happy ? " elizabeth ' s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express  
elizabeth would not observe her  
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again  
and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife  
if , indeed , such a report is in existence  
miss bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room  
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman  
well , how pleased i am ! and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now  
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous  
fatigued as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance  
lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly marked features , which might once have been handsome  
and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds  
your name will never even be mentioned by any of us  
jane heard them with horror  
" this was invitation enough  
" " i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want  
" her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth  
one does not know what to think  
though we can never be what we once were to each other  
well , he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now  
and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which jane was equally eager to satisfy  
" " such as vanity and pride  
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me  
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him  
she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother  
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend  
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do  
elizabeth immediately began playing again  
excuse me for i must speak plainly  
chapter iv  
one ought not to repine  
to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth  
and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour  
colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief  
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell , but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you  
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish  
" " go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks  
but don't imagine it was from any silly cause  
he meant to resign his commission immediately  
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield  
and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together  
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes  
elizabeth could not help saying , " it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so  
" she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham  
but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved  
" elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy  
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined  
i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming  
she has two nieces of her own  
u  
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough  
" next time you call , " said she , " i hope we shall be more lucky  
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph  
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct  
and not a note , not a line , did i receive in the mean time  
on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer  
there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! such an openness and gentleness in his manner  
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high  
" " and i have another favour to ask  
i am sure you must feel it so  
but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry  
they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering  
you know not what you are about  
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse  
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings , and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening  
" " i can much more easily believe mr bingley ' s being imposed on , than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night  
" elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room  
" " i do not believe a word of it , my dear  
the pause was to elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful  
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley  
after a short silence , the lady first spoke  
though lydia had never been a favourite with them , mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeply affected  
they may be modified and printed and given away you may do practically anything with public domain ebooks  
" " may we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? " " take whatever you like , and get away  
their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast room  
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications  
" they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea  
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment  
and you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner  
mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates  
but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment  
but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way  
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss bingley ' s voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family  
your ' s , &c  
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage  
the first week of their return was soon gone  
and she seized the opportunity of saying , " is your sister at pemberley still ? " " yes , she will remain there till christmas  
one day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance  
his revenge would have been complete indeed  
mr darcy is engaged to my _  
" " perhaps that is not possible for any one  
these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay  
are the others coming out ? " " i do not know  
this son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for  
nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit  
<num> 
but her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy mr collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship ' s praise into his own hands  
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility  
she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence  
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , mr bennet coolly observed , " from all that i can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country  
the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me  
" " it is difficult indeed it is distressing  
" this was a sad omen of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be  
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it  
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters i cannot understand  
if he had _ motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him  
however , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and i am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves  
" darcy only smiled  
and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton  
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood  
and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him  
mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them  
it was an encouragement of vice  
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party  
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person  
she was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper  
yours ever , " caroline bingley  
of course , we hope that you will support the project gutenberg tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg tm name associated with the work  
and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls  
" mr darcy , who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise  
i shall like it of all things  
which are naturally lively enough  
" you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking  
you agree that the foundation , the trademark owner , and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual , direct , indirect , consequential , punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage  
" " and what am i to do on the occasion ? it seems an hopeless business  
" can you deny that you have done it ? " she repeated  
with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises  
" " in marrying your nephew , i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere  
" " but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about  
it was unpardonable  
it had been written five days ago  
i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day  
mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house  
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister  
to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success  
" it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , mr bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me  
" " but he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather ' s death made her mistress of this fortune  
she could not think of darcy ' s leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him  
but he soon afterwards said , " i was surprised to see darcy in town last month  
so , do not put yourself to inconvenience  
" i confess , " said he , " that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship ' s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings  
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine  
and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away  
" but it must be done  
but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class  
i assure you , that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it  
" what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr darcy ! there is nothing like dancing after all  
you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf  
" you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing  
" elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement  
and then when we came away it was such fun ! i thought we never should have got into the coach  
mr bennet ' s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation  
" and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother ? " said mr gardiner  
it seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her  
" " beyond a doubt , they do wish him to chuse miss darcy , " replied jane  
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard  
" then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself  
that his two sisters and mr darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable  
mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public  
you may use this ebook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works , reports , performances and research  
and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject  
i hope they will not meet at all  
i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt  
" she is so fond of mrs forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away ! and there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much  
charlotte herself was tolerably composed  
the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances  
but i do not know when that will be  
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired  
he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it  
" she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it  
my dear , dear lydia ! how merry we shall be together when we meet ! " her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardiner ' s behaviour laid them all under  
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared  
and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor  
" i often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ' s friends  
" " very true , indeed  
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one  
" my dear father , i congratulate you  
i must have employment and society  
and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet  
" " oh ! your father of course may spare you , if your mother can  
" mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? poor eliza ! to be only just tolerable  
while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes  
she comes here to morrow with him  
but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " engaged to mr collins ! my dear charlotte , impossible ! " the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach  
and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister  
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , " when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood  
their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence  
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure  
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth  
it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling  
of the lady ' s sensations they remained a little in doubt  
" " obstinate , headstrong girl ! i am ashamed of you ! is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? is nothing due to me on that score ? " let us sit down  
but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth  
mr bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements  
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner  
" " yes , very well  
i had often seen him in love before  
you shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness  
but what does he say of the living ? " " he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only  
he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia  
what could your ladyship propose by it ? " " at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted  
for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting  
not lydia only , but all were concerned in it  
but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts  
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified  
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention  
the possibility of mr collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two  
mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display  
no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it  
and his civilities were worn out like his information  
but i suppose you had no opportunity  
elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well  
" and that , " said mrs reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master and very like him  
sir william staid only a week at hunsford  
but his companion was not disposed to make any  
" lizzy , you must not do so  
not a syllable was uttered by either  
there was also a postscript to this effect  
we will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen  
and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them  
" if i should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia  
after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball  
you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us  
the person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund  
" this was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas  
she is quite a little creature  
i send no compliments to your mother  
she could think only of her letter  
chapter xx  
when this was done , she had a less active part to play  
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction  
the same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening  
it is impossible  
and as for mr hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her  
a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself  
on finding mrs bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? " before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , mrs bennet instantly answered , " oh dear ! yes certainly  
no , no , let me shift for myself  
the country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , mr bingley ? " " when i am in the country , " he replied , " i never wish to leave it  
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him  
" why , my dear , you must know , mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england  
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth : " my dearest lizzy , " i find myself very unwell this morning , which , i suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday  
and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about  
but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies  
i should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off  
your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together  
it was impossible not to long to know  
two obstacles of the five being thus removed , mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them  
she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement  
" mr darcy ' s letter to lady catherine , was in a different style  
he had lost every point  
but , on second thoughts , perhaps lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person  
if you are a good girl for the next ten years , i will take you to a review at the end of them  
" he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group  
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness  
" " complied with ! i am only ashamed of his asking so little  
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn  
mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed  
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour ' s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment  
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me  
as they passed through the hall , lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on  
but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on  
" " you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate  
in another minute mr bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend  
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference  
mr wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia  
" " yes  
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia  
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn  
" is miss darcy much grown since the spring ? " said miss bingley  
the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport  
i now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him  
after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read  
chapter iii  
i certainly have had my share of beauty , but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now  
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr darcy  
" " i am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate  
how could i be so silly as to wish it ! your idea of the ponies is delightful  
" i am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with  
" there is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said kitty  
but vanity , not love , has been my folly  
and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report  
we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough  
" i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her  
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned  
to the last  
but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr collins ' s correspondence for any consideration  
when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do  
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body  
if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin  
if i may so express it , he has a right to be proud  
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully  
whether he had been aware of jane ' s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation  
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world  
my good opinion once lost is lost for ever  
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded  
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words " apology , " " hunsford , " and " lady catherine de bourgh  
i thought i should have died  
he is a gentleman  
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money  
and mrs bennet , for many years after lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would  
under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief  
and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read  
and with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ' s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn  
it is of all subjects my delight  
" mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham ' s removal from the shire , as clearly as mr gardiner could do  
mr collins readily assented , and a book was produced  
" yes , ma'am , that he was indeed  
his former acquaintance had been numerous  
and now we are better  
at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner  
accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer  
it was an evening of no common delight to them all  
but she does not know , no one can know how much i suffer from what she says  
" " how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it ! but i wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself  
now is your time  
all were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and kitty and lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot  
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family  
the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention  
" " i must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied jane , " and i hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together  
" mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character  
again she read on  
but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love  
" " my dear , you flatter me  
" elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts  
" and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes  
regard for my sister ' s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge  
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham  
" " no why should he ? if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections , because i had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? " " but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event  
" indeed you have no reason  
when the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother ' s rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party  
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began  
how can you be so teazing ? " " i honour your circumspection  
" i am afraid , mr darcy , " observed miss bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes  
after this day , jane said no more of her indifference  
" i have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech  
for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil  
mr collins then returned to elizabeth  
pride and prejudice : a novel  
it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best  
" chapter iv  
" it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man  
and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes  
elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her  
as for your elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? " " it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied  
" " but you are not entitled to know mine  
" well , well , and so mr bingley is coming down , sister , " ( for mrs philips first brought her the news  
" a long dispute followed this declaration  
kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia ' s last letter , she had prepared her for such a step  
" " i can easily believe it  
without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person  
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs philips ' s manners and politeness  
it was at sir william lucas ' s , where a large party were assembled  
it was really attentive  
" " mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself ? " " no  
" and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well  
but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough  
" " i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever  
mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride  
he hardly ever mentioned your name  
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? mr bingley will not be detained in london by them  
i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married  
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it  
mrs reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s life time  
they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride  
but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr darcy walk into the room  
" what do you mean , mr bennet , by talking in this way ? you promised me to insist upon her marrying him  
" " did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? " " i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady  
but she checked herself  
it is enough to know they are discovered , i have seen them both " " then it is , as i always hoped , " cried jane  
" " that you certainly shall  
my father and mother believe the worst , but i cannot think so ill of him  
it is such a spur to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind  
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother ' s schemes  
ring the bell , kitty , for hill  
mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton  
jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way  
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind  
and continually was she repeating , " why is he so altered ? from what can it proceed ? it cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened  
for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing  
they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence  
i told you so from the first , you may remember  
end of vol  
we must not all expect jane ' s good fortune  
" " oh ! where , where is my uncle ? " cried elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious  
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was  
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it  
" " when i wrote that letter , " replied darcy , " i believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit  
the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants  
and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look  
but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites  
and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement  
it was really a very handsome thought  
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility  
and considering mr collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state  
but i must write no more  
and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down stairs from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her  
they stood for some time without speaking a word  
i shall certainly try to get the better  
but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money  
i grieve to find , however , that colonel f  
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford  
but she would not be secure  
" but surely , " said she , " i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me  
i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , i have seen nothing of it  
chapter vi  
and you must feel , as well as i do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking  
and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennet ' s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property  
this information , however , startled mrs bennet  
she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago  
but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain  
there was good humour and kindness  
" my aunt , " she continued , " is going to morrow into that part of the town , and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street  
they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria  
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end  
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children  
" " but i hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood  
" oh ! she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld ! but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and i dare say , very agreeable  
but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy  
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling  
he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself  
" elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word  
there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it  
miss darcy , on her brother ' s entrance , exerted herself much more to talk  
and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt  
this is my advice  
" " and then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books  
charlotte the wife of mr collins , was a most humiliating picture ! and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen  
but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , " come here , my love , i want to speak to you , " took her out of the room  
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but i hardly know what i have written  
by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance  
but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out  
in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron  
but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance  
i am going to gretna green , and if you cannot guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel  
" " can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? " " this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage  
" " if ! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ? do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? " " i never heard that it was  
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer  
i cannot misunderstand you , but i intreat you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that _ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk  
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune  
" " are you , indeed ? and pray what sort of guardians do you make ? does your charge give you much trouble ? young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way  
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them  
if i was to go through the world , i could not meet with a better  
" i am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said lady catherine  
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense  
" what could he mean ? she was dying to know what could be his meaning " and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ? " not at all , " was her answer  
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken  
james ' s , with very decent composure  
but that gentleman , " looking at darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all  
how shall we punish him for such a speech ? " " nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said elizabeth  
but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation  
" " no , nothing at all  
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth  
the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation  
and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire  
on the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased  
mr darcy replied with great intrepidity , " miss elizabeth bennet  
but i thought i might as well buy it as not  
will you tell me how long you have loved him ? " " it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began  
you shall hear what she says  
chapter xi  
the former continued the subject , by saying , " but tell me all and every thing about it , which i have not already heard  
their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush  
not one party , or scheme , or any thing  
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter  
and in her air altogether , there is a self sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable  
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment  
neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable  
he studies too much for words of four syllables  
the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken  
gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection  
but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it  
mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , " this walk is not wide enough for our party  
he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend  
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced  
" then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson  
it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could feel gratitude , i would now thank you  
now what have you to say ? " " only this  
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on  
and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance  
" mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment  
the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr darcy could not have  
the gentlemen arrived early  
i take up my pen again to do , what i have just told you i would not , but circumstances are such , that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible  
there was no want of discourse  
in which case you may be sure of my pardon  
but i always speak what i think  
miss bingley saw all this likewise  
a thousand things may arise in six months ! " the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt  
" elizabeth asked questions in vain  
you must not suspect me  
and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike  
and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick  
" chapter iv  
and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day  
their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency  
on the strength of darcy ' s regard bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion  
the younger girls formed hopes of coming _ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done  
too _ , i am afraid  
" " it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should  
mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them  
but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you  
the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this  
" how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr darcy , " she cried  
i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham ' s character  
" oh ! yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen  
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children  
even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away  
he looked serious as usual  
chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for my sake  
but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post  
" " colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia ' s side , but nothing to give him any alarm  
" " no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did  
however , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were  
" but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there  
" " his manners are very different from his cousin ' s  
mr hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad  
the old lady is mrs jenkinson , who lives with them  
till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation , colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself  
but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection  
and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr wickham  
and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else  
" jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern  
he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room  
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter  
that he was surprised by the connexion was evident  
nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again  
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good natured , gossiping lucases  
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast

but i do not think there would have been any fun in it  
adding , with a significant smile , " i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here  
but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness  
and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , " pray , miss eliza , are not the shire militia removed from meryton ? they must be a great loss to your family  
" elizabeth almost stared at her  
" but what is to be done about pemberley ? " cried mrs gardiner  
i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older  
at our time of life , it is not so pleasant i can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day  
and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man , asked her how she had liked him  
there was no arguing upon such a project  
she retreated from the window , fearful of being seen  
this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married  
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room  
a little time therefore  
elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word  
the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor  
that he was not a good tempered man , had been her firmest opinion  
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton  
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned  
you both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage  
he was too happy , however , to need much attention  
but , alas ! the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair  
and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise  
we were always good friends  
" replied her sister  
" " i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied  
mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card  
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham  
and her features are not at all handsome  
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking  
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture  
howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair  
and lydia , self willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing  
they came  
my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge  
and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them  
" bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business  
" if it were merely a fine house richly furnished , " said she , " i should not care about it myself  
" " indeed ! " cried wickham with a look which did not escape her  
on being made acquainted with the present mr darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured boy

i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together  
and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter  
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it  
but on returning to the drawing room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her  
" jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness  
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct  
his regard for her was quite imaginary  
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter  
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband  
i am a gentleman ' s daughter  
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of mr darcy ' s proposals  
it was dated from rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows : " be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you  
upon the whole , i am much pleased with him  
lord ! how i should like to be married before any of you  
" " you did ! and it was not wholly without foundation  
you have employed your time much better  
" as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth  
" you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! unfeeling , selfish girl ! do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? " " lady catherine , i have nothing farther to say  
the possibility of meeting mr darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred  
" how strange this is ! and for this we are to be thankful  
" i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society  
after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , mr collins attending them to point out its beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer  
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen  
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable  
she was going to the butcher ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed  
" words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings  
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley  
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room  
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much  
a great deal more passed at the other table

his sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile  
i told my sister philips so the other day  
our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia ' s character  
the hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised  
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable  
but against this , there were objections  
my temper would perhaps be called resentful  
" and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal

" can it be possible that he will marry her ? " " wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him  
on opening the door , she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation  
but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone  
mr gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation  
" well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ? is not he a charming man ? i am sure my sisters must all envy me  
my child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life  
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette  
elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane ' s being in the fairest way for happiness  
since her father ' s death , her home has been london , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education  
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects  
she dreaded seeing wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible  
and still thought there might have been time enough  
" " well , then supposing them to be in london  
it was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes  
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingley ' s continued absence  
this however was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough  
it became her turn to listen  
i thank you , again and again , for not going to the lakes  
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance  
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together  
there is something very pompous in his style  
lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself  
we had better not mention it  
as all conversation was thereby at an end , elizabeth soon afterwards left the room  
she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn , had by some accident been lost  
and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem  
there is nothing he would not do for her  
" you doubt me , " cried jane , slightly colouring  
be assured , my dear sir , that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove  
what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy ? you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing  
if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer  
" " mr darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again  
" " compared with some families , i believe we were  
her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted  
but now it was all too natural  
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable  
and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time  
i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure  
she will make him a very proper wife  
" having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority  
" you are too hasty , sir , " she cried  
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room  
" vol  
and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest  
iii  
if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him ? " " because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it  
the apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it  
chapter xiv  
how thankful am i , that we never let them know what has been said against him  
" " neglect ! i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place  
the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room  
every savage can dance  
" you are joking , lizzy  
" " has she been presented ? i do not remember her name among the ladies at court  
a scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful  
at such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented  
you wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if i speak ill of any body  
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and mr collins , in describing the civility of mr and mrs philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house  
but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew  
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule  
i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman  
will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him  
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry  
mrs bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment  
as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire  
and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire  
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november , for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace  
why should they try to influence him ? they can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it  
yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over  
but now as the first shock is over , shall i own that i long for your return ? i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient  
it will pass away soon enough  
" " is this a hint to me , lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? " " no , indeed  
he took the hint , and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " that will do extremely well , child  
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine , and her daughter  
" " indeed i do not dare  
" elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her  
" elizabeth turned away to hide a smile  
gardiner  
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else  
arguments are too much like disputes  
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way  
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition  
my feelings in every respect forbid it  
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more  
it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ' s being in town  
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not  
i cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done  
but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead  
i am so pleased so happy  
" " you must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied elizabeth  
" how abominable ! i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you ! if from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest , for dishonesty i must call it  
elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation  
consider how important every moment is , in such a case  
on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another  
and that being the case , i cannot consider your situation with much compassion  
they are wanted in the farm , mr bennet , are not they ? " " they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them  
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character  
" you dislike an argument , and want to silence this  
but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s frailty would have mortified her so much  
limited warranty , disclaimer of damages except for the " right of replacement or refund " described in paragraph <num> 
and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of pemberley might be something ! they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door  
and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too  
and elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane  
he cannot afford it  
poor jane ! i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately  
and , perhaps , if i have very good luck , i may meet with another mr collins in time  
my watchfulness has been effectual  
rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother in law ' s intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit  
colonel fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman  
the first part of mrs gardiner ' s business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions  
but i am an idle fellow , and though i have not many , i have more than i ever look into  
and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side  
and if you are not kind to us , brother , i do not know what we shall do  
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her  
but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence  
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law  
to caroline ' s assertion of her brother ' s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit

all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light  
and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers  
" we have dined nine times at rosings , besides drinking tea there twice ! how much i shall have to tell ! " elizabeth privately added , " and how much i shall have to conceal  
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children  
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming  
but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man  
and secondly , of my room  
" " but , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him  
you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its being _  
vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously  
" yet why did he come ? " she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself  
he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him  
section <num> 
consider mr collins ' s respectability , and charlotte ' s prudent , steady character  
" " my object then , " replied darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past  
but it is all , all too late now  
" " with the officers ! " cried lydia  
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton  
though lydia ' s short letter to mrs f  
miss bennet , i insist on being satisfied  
i wonder when you would have spoken , if i had not asked you ! my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect  
the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions  
" how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! her aunt now called her to look at a picture  
" but so we all do  
" whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment  
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters  
but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic  
her husband looked impenetrably grave  
" mr wickham ' s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family  
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly  
mr wickham had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight  
in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great  
i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to  
" for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy ' s steward , and of that , i can assure you , he informed me himself  
i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her  
for mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion  
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent  
" elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded  
london : printed for t  
" " i suspected as much , " replied elizabeth  
for she was in no cheerful humour  
and on the part of mrs bennet and kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what elizabeth felt  
she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy , she moved again towards the gate  
" i did not think caroline in spirits , " were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london  
he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others  
newby chief executive and director gbnewby<mention> 
he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence  
now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits  
in truth i must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings  
he cannot know what mr darcy is  
in lydia ' s imagination , a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness  
it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground  
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg tm license when you share it without charge with others  
he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london  
the garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving  
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise  
and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcy ' s sister , as , by wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away  
and miss darcy is always down for the summer months  
in a short time , i shall have a daughter married  
the subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away  
" yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " i remember hearing you once say , mr darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable  
mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk  
his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! oh ! it must be my uncle ' s doings ! generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself  
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world  
and one of my own daughters  
and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards  
and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked  
elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view  
" but depend upon it , mr collins , " she added , " that lizzy shall be brought to reason  
" and pray may i ask ? " but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , " is it in address that he improves ? has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? for i dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials  
" what does mr darcy mean , " said she to charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? " " that is a question which mr darcy only can answer  
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed  
never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f  
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week  
" well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual  
let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood  
" but how could that be ? how could his will be disregarded ? why did not you seek legal redress ? " " there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law  
but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility  
" " would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " " he made a little mistake to be sure  
" " to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! what could she mean by it ? it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum  
" elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact  
and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself  
he begged pardon for having displeased her  
bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased  
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , i dare say  
she then took a large house in edward street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings  
and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings  
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself  
in short , i will do my best  
" of what are you talking ? " " of mr collins and lizzy  
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper  
had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it  
her colour changed , and she said no more  
" " to be sure , lizzy , " said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as wickham  
" i know not , miss elizabeth , " said he , " whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it  
and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former  
" " yes  
" or in other words , you are determined to have him  
and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise  
good heaven ! brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of meryton  
" it must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year  
she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself  
" when you have killed all your own birds , mr bingley , " said her mother , " i beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on mr bennet ' s manor  
" she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment  
as soon as jane had read mr gardiner ' s hope of lydia ' s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance  
" " what sort of a girl is miss darcy ? " he shook his head  
and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane , with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy  
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe  
calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly  
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife  
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted  
" with my mother up stairs  
she asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s maiden name ? elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly  
mr wickham began the subject himself  
mrs bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected  
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow  
and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning  
" upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock  
but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief  
" " to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you  
" believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections  
and that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter  
nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of lydia ' s infamy somewhat better  
he still loves me , and we are engaged  
to miss lydia bennet ,' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing  
" " you are severe on us  
and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card table , and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game  
a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room  
but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane ' s sake , you know  
and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better  
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode  
" " aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield , and he could not help answering her  
she could not win him , however , to any conversation  
because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth  
" " pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? where does discretion end , and avarice begin ? last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent  
within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors  
" you begin to comprehend me , do you ? " cried he , turning towards her  
in the former were many good paintings  
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage  
you are lucky in having such a master  
and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out  
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country  
" the whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs philips  
send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly  
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all  
and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr darcy ' s civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister  
" your ' s , &c  
i am not equal to it  
they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all  
till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea  
" my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way  
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement  
i must beg to return to the house  
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr darcy  
and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley  
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " i beg your pardon , but i must leave you  
lydia was lydia still  
" " nothing is more deceitful , " said darcy , " than the appearance of humility  
he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself  
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears  
i have met with two instances lately  
he drew a chair near her  
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared  
" eliza bennet , " said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own  
but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object  
sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man  
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it  
it was all conjecture  
he made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him  
but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger  
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew  
" and may i ask ? " said elizabeth , " but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with  
the hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object  
and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter  
our poor mother is sadly grieved  
and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady ' s removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at clapham  
and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once  
" " i wish i might take this for a compliment  
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity  
mr collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many  
" and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your _ make such an exhibition  
and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections  
you cannot go yourself  
the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ' s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence  
it was my brother gardiner ' s drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it  
" " i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more  
for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious  
but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it  
a fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly very little  
that was impossible  
and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second  
" " and what did she say ? " " that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well  
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever  
i know no harm of her  
" " oh ! my dear brother , " replied mrs bennet , " that is exactly what i could most wish for  
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state  
they will have nothing else to do  
but now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in lydia ' s marriage  
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose  
but it is not sound  
" " you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which i have never acknowledged  
but now , as bingley ' s friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me  
but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal  
" their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm  
as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth  
and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle  
he left netherfield for london , on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning  
indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not  
" " that is his notion of christian forgiveness ! the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte ' s situation , and his expectation of a young olive branch  
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence , strict liability , breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph <num> 
and when i returned home , the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight ' s time  
" she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr hurst had a house  
" grieved shocked  
and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend  
" of music ! then pray speak aloud  
young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life  
she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us  
" " her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town  
not that i care about it , though  
but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet  
" " la ! " replied kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before  
" and her residence there will probably be of some duration  
it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men  
the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual  
" i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ' s intimates in the regiment , whether wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself  
lady catherine might see him in her way through town  
mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears  
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us  
" " very true , my dear , that is exactly what i say  
" he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped  
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret  
elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation  
when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses  
" " and if i had not a letter to write myself , i might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did  
and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful  
when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him  
you could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine  
and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown  
they were ignorant , idle , and vain  
with the mention of derbyshire , there were many ideas connected  
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship ! how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! how much of good or evil must be done by him ! every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before  
but on perceiving mr darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner  
miss bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcy ' s progress through his book , as in reading her own  
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart  
but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man  
" i see what you are feeling , " replied charlotte , " you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you  
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy ' s marriage  
she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise  
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before  
and , though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy ' s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring  
but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder  
and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual  
but only because her husband ' s regiment happens to be so far off  
she could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress  
but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly  
these were the contents : " my dear harriet , " you will laugh when you know where i am gone , and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning , as soon as i am missed  
and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been  
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan  
and after observing mr collins for a few moments , he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh  
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive  
it was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it  
to all the objections i have already urged , i have still another to add  
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here  
a younger son , you know , must be inured to self denial and dependence  
though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them  
you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner  
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names  
" who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? " " his misfortunes ! " repeated darcy contemptuously  
i hope she will turn out well  
" " it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire  
mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once  
" " but , my dear , you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood  
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball  
and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little  
but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had  
" you look pale  
" lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue  
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth  
but this would be nothing if you really liked him  
when she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it  
but your family owe me nothing  
" " yes  
on saturday he came again  
wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks  
yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance  
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here  
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me  
" mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it  
whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish  
" " what should not you mind ? " " i should not mind any thing at all  
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages  
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr darcy then was  
she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence  
you know how i detest it , unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner  
she was not rendered formidable by silence  
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice  
" " dear lizzy ! " " oh ! you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general  
he has not an ill natured look  
and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene  
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen  
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered  
" " is this , " thought elizabeth , " meant for me ? " and she coloured at the idea  
he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected  
my poor father ! how he must have felt it ! " " i never saw any one so shocked  
he bore it however with admirable calmness  
" " no , that i am sure i shall not  
her complexion has no brilliancy  
i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies  
and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds  
he introduced us to his sister  
but nothing can be done  
the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him  
found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence  
but from every window there were beauties to be seen  
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible  
" chapter xviii  
" there were some very strong objections against the lady , " were colonel fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london  
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way  
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live  
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which i cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects  
here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind  
and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love  
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees  
i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been  
jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare  
and to be kept back on such a motive ! i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind  
and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged  
for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of  
" " i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness  
" darcy was fixed in astonishment  
you have a sweet room here , mr bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk  
" i must go instantly to my mother  
but would my giving you the wished for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ? supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged  
vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self destined to another  
" " that is the most unforgiving speech , " said elizabeth , " that i ever heard you utter  
) " well , so much the better  
" lady catherine seemed resigned  
and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street  
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object  
lydia came to us  
and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room  
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends  
and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned  
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him ! he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! not handsome enough to dance with ! i wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs  
" how can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! you will not be fit to be seen when you get there  
and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister  
lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy  
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " how long did you say that he was at rosings ? " " nearly three weeks  
what could be the meaning of it ? it was impossible to imagine  
and besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites

i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere  
" " you persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him  
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint  
" " true  
and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr darcy ' s steward  
" mr gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks  
i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements  
with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage  
it was hardly enough  
" elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them  
for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction  
" mr darcy smiled  
it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh ' s family  
but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day  
lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule  
and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her  
" " mary and kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , i am sure , but i did not think it right for either of them  
jane was so admired , nothing could be like it  
" i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter  
she dared not even mention that gentleman  
and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal  
and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again  
all connection between us seemed now dissolved  
but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done  
he was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " just as you please  
" " kitty has no discretion in her coughs , " said her father  
it was an animating subject , and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match  
" while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning  
" " i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man  
but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him

the note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with  
one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions  
miss bingley did the same  
in a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost  
my mother means well  
till this moment , i never knew myself  
lydia was a stout , well grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance  
" " oh ! " said lydia stoutly , " i am not afraid  
but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable  
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct  
and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to mrs hill and the two housemaids  
i know it to be impossible  
and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits  
and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect  
they were dances of mortification  
" who can it be ? " " some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose  
for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power  
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them  
any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings  
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever  
she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy  
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room  
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr collins was only a clergyman  
mr collins made his declaration in form  
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley  
but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful  
and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country  
" " lady catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour  
condolence , insufferable  
he was fond of the country and of books  
nothing could be more delightful ! to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love  
soon after you left me on saturday , i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were  
" again his astonishment was obvious  
" this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret  
and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly  
but depend upon it i will carry my point  
but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well  
the very last evening was spent there  
i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it  
" " i shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you  
she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford  
a clergyman like you must marry  
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit  
" " mama , " cried lydia , " my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson ' s as they did when they first came  
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this  
and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future  
but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life  
she coloured as she spoke  
" " for heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower  
you may have drawn him in  
i am impatient to see him  
" " in such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of  
and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy  
i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long  
she talked to elizabeth again and again  
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it  
it is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world  
" it keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and i am more obliged to you than i can express  
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding  
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him  
" it would be nothing  
without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy  
they then went away  
his surprise was great  
they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either  
having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry  
chapter ix  
i desire you will stay where you are  
and sir william , to elizabeth ' s high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way  
" does that young lady know mr darcy ? " elizabeth coloured , and said " a little  
it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before  
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it  
she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject  
he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners  
in anticipating the happiness of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house  
you alluded to something else  
[ illustration : matlock ] pride and prejudice : a novel  
four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt ' s arrival  
" " yes , she did  
" " but consider your daughters  
every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace  
" " but i was embarrassed  
my father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be  
it is a nice long walk , and mr darcy has never seen the view  
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill  
she enquired into charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all  
and from all bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own  
but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you  
it is not quite a week since they left brighton  
i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when mr denny comes back from town  
but what is that to me ? if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh  
" mrs hill began instantly to express her joy  
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society  
mr philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before  
unless a copyright notice is included  
lady catherine , sir william , and mr and mrs collins sat down to quadrille  
and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs  
but mrs bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed  
that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs forster called her , and they were going to the camp  
make haste , and come down this moment  
but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish  
" " oh ! your uncle ! he keeps a man servant , does he ? i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things  
and she asked bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present  
but these are not jane ' s feelings  
her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable  
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone  
but for your sakes , we would do any thing  
" elizabeth shook her head over this letter  
" " do you really think so ? " cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment  
the discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome  
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects  
they were of a respectable family in the north of england  
people did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas  
" " can i have the carriage ? " said jane  
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better  
" " i admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason  
but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice  
and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way  
" " you go to brighton ! i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds ! no , kitty , i have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it  
elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr wickham and herself  
and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , " if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure  
mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley ' s visit in gracechurch street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance  
but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival of jane  
but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr and mrs collins ' s happiness  
her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home  
as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " this is a most unfortunate affair  
but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given  
i will only add , god bless you  
and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses  
on mr and mrs gardiner ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment  
" " have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ? but now it comes out  
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow  
and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself  
but he seemed to like his second better  
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill  
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds  
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject  
where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil  
" not at all  
" very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ? " " i have , sir  
but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister  
" " how can you talk so ? " said jane faintly smiling , " you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could not hesitate  
his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk  
" excuse my interference  
lady catherine ' s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts  
as no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all mr collins ' s scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton  
her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters  
mr bennet indeed said little  
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance  
" her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano forte was opened , and darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it  
" " yes  
and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , " my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing ? mr darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner  
she has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever  
did you see him while you were at lambton ? i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had  
who could about such a nasty little freckled thing ? " elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal ! as soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered  
he actually danced with her twice  
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon  
elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill  
" 'tis an etiquette i despise , " said he

" it is a handsome face  
mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off  
for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to mr bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at hunsford  
it was very little less  
their parties abroad were less varied than before  
and i trust i am resigned  
it was only said , 'lately , george wickham , esq  
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from lady catherine  
there is one point , on which i want your advice  
" " an easy distance do you call it ? it is nearly fifty miles  
but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine  
" elizabeth made no objection  
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name  
and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say , three very silly sisters  
it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! another day i will do the same  
he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter  
and mr bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign  
she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself  
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine  
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday  
and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least  
" " these are heavy misfortunes , " replied elizabeth  
bingley was quite uncomfortable  
" if he wants our society , let him seek it  
her many attractions were again dwelt on , and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter  
but , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt  
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support  
" i have sent for you on an affair of importance  
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity  
for my part , i am inclined to believe it all mr darcy ' s , but you shall do as you chuse  
sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it  
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time  
but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman  
poor lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough  
" their party in the dining room was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them  
elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain  
i am going away myself  
" there , mrs bennet  
the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice  
and he soon afterwards said aloud , " mr bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day ? " " i advise mr darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , " said mrs bennet , " to walk to oakham mount this morning  
i promised them so faithfully ! what will wickham say ? it was to be such a secret ! " " if it was to be secret , " said jane , " say not another word on the subject  
i do not know who is good enough for him  
were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express  
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished  
its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn  
two days after mr bennet ' s return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her  
and mr darcy had much better finish his letter  
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory  
a few days after this visit , mr bingley called again , and alone  
their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! let me never see either one or the other again ! " yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover  
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object  
the good news quickly spread through the house  
those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild  
miss bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when jane testified such concern in parting with her , that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present  
" " i am sure i shall break mine , " said lydia  
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use  
elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply  
" a short pause followed this speech , and mrs hurst began again  
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak  
" then , " observed elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman  
and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else  
" as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession  
the adieu is charity itself  
i depend on you for that  
for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased  
and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away  
it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side  
but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt  
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? " " oh , yes ! you will only think i feel more than i ought to do , when i tell you all  
mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding  
his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary  
he was angry  
but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body  
she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her  
* * * * * mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother  
you refuse , then , to oblige me  
" you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age  
never , since reading jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of wickham ' s meaning to marry her  
" i have an excessive regard for jane bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and i wish with all my heart she were well settled  
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both  
he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them  
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom  
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn  
but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most  
" no  
but he saw only the father  
kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters  
and as dawson does not object to the barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , i should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large  
" i know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object  
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure  
" " i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object  
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could  
and mrs collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much  
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners  
" miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister ' s warm affection  
the least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person  
i should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire  
he was full of joy and attention  
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of mr collins  
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling  
assistance is impossible  
of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant  
but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable  
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth ' s performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste  
there is a lady , it seems , a mrs younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what  
" on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away  
do not you , darcy ? " " my style of writing is very different from yours  
not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself  
it was to this effect : " since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature  
" " tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? " though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question  
for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father ' s will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions  
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning  
from that moment i observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively  
i am the happiest creature in the world  
there is nothing else to be done  
most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education  
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself  
for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr darcy afterwards discharged  
" " not that i shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter  
" " i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one  
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word  
it should not be said , that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers  
with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation  
" " you are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body ! if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers  
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope , though you have but a short lease  
the business of her life was to get her daughters married  
we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man  
" he then told her of georgiana ' s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption  
when at length they arose to take leave , mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn  
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions  
but jane was to go home with her , and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation  
" and this is always the way with him , " she added  
" " i must not decide on my own performance  
when mrs bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before  
or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent ' s mind  
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour  
with a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee  
mr wickham ' s chief object was unquestionably my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds  
it was not their wish to force her communication  
chapter ii  
four or five thousand a year  
mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family  
chapter viii  
" " i believe , ma'am , i may safely promise you never to dance with him  
it is every way horrible ! " darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence  
" and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter  
" " what you ask , " said elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side  
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here  
such a countenance , such manners ! and so extremely accomplished for her age ! her performance on the piano forte is exquisite  
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way  
mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me  
mr bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other  
and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement  
but i will make her know it  
though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood  
she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother  
and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion  
and she was only sixteen last june  
and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like any thing  
that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately  
will you hear it ? " " most willingly  
chapter xiv  
from what he said of miss darcy , i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl  
their situation was awkward enough  
or me either , for that matter  
but he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not  
if elizabeth , when mr darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents  
" without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first  
and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st  
and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls  
" " what do you mean , hill ? we have heard nothing from town  
i only hope they may have half my good luck  
miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous  
do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley  
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong  
her report was highly favourable  
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , i am sure  
secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness  
well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better  
and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation  
you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly  
" mr gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from colonel forster  
but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien  
mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner  
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching  
wickham will never marry a woman without some money  
and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day  
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed  
mr gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject  
" oh , lizzy ! it cannot be  
the business was therefore soon settled  
nor will i be dissuaded from it  
" in darcy ' s presence she dared not mention wickham ' s name  
a carat character is used to denote superscription  
and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country  
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room  
but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected  
" " let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility  
mrs bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of  
stop me whilst you can  
when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley  
sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance  
they could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for mr darcy  
" if i had been able , " said she , " to carry my point of going to brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened  
and very unwillingly said so  
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home  
but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves  
about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion  
" " i deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried elizabeth  
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible  
darcy was delighted with their engagement  
but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent  
" how could i ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in her face  
allowing for the common demands of the game , mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy  
she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it  
they were natural and just  
you must and shall be married by a special licence  
" the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy  
by this time she is actually with them ! if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! " " we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said jane : " i hope and trust they will yet be happy  
and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham  
" he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself  
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him  
" " indeed , mama , you are mistaken , " said elizabeth , blushing for her mother  
laws alone swamp our small staff  
" " i beg you would not put it into lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill treatment  
it was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more information  
only three miles  
every thing nourishes what is strong already  
in future , i hope we shall be always of one mind  
the rector of a parish has much to do  
she studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different  
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy  
you and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , mr bingley might like you the best of the party  
but not long was the interval of tranquillity  
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions  
and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning  
" i am sure , " said she , " i cried for two days together when colonel millar ' s regiment went away  
there was no help for it however  
maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire  
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady ' s attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others  
it was a large , well proportioned room , handsomely fitted up  
" and , before she could reply , he added , " it is above eight months  
mr bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man  
oh ! how acutely did she now feel it  
and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister  
she read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again  
" " no , " said colonel fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me  
you are a gentleman ' s daughter  
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related  
it is impossible for me to be impartial  
" but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago  
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit  
and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty  
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth  
" there has been many a one , i fancy , overcome in the same way  
and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr bennet were dead  
your profusion makes me saving  
could there be finer symptoms ? is not general incivility the very essence of love ? " " oh , yes ! of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt  
if , indeed , it should be so ! but i dare not hope it  
his doing so drew her notice  
for herself she was humbled  
" then shewing her purchases : " look here , i have bought this bonnet  
and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart  
it was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her ' s  
" she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley  
her own thoughts were employing her  
i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all  
your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land  
" " the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard  
for he is now in the custody of his friend , and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london ! my dear aunt , how could you think of it ? mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month ' s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it  
" " but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model  
" i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows  
and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world  
mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required  
he heard her with astonishment  
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money  
egerton , military library , whitehall  
but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ? all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry  
" " would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? " " upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter , darcy must speak for himself  
if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach  
and the hursts have no horses to theirs  
" what would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? " were questions with which she amused herself  
" elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced  
my head is always full of something else  
one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief  
she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom  
" she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged  
oh ! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him  
to the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingley ' s , she could not make a very favourable answer  
her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it  
and yet there have been things enough happened in the time  
and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest  
" mr collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter  
and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared

" * * * * * it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey  
and what claims has lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge  
when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go  
" " i will not trust myself on the subject , " replied wickham , " i can hardly be just to him  
but that is one great difference between us  
her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else  
his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue  
and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort  
mr gardiner was a sensible , gentleman like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education  
forgive me  
" mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ' s ill breeding , and made no answer  
but their progress was slow , for mr gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little  
" " undoubtedly  
" tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley ' s  
well , any friend of mr bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure  
i will take care of myself , and of mr wickham too  
and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals  
" elizabeth looked surprised  
" " well , " cried elizabeth , " have it as you choose  
she had seen enough of bingley ' s behaviour to jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last  
he now wished it more than ever  
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother  
one seems so forlorn without them  
was not a man to be trusted  
" " an excellent consolation in its way , " said elizabeth , " but it will not do for us  
charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility  
but she did weep from vexation and envy  
" away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech  
" and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly  
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching pemberley  
" " i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time  
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock  
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceived again  
and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr darcy  
and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so good humoured as lydia  
" but to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable  
there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be  
and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " he is a man of very large property in derbyshire , i understand  
" " whatever my connections may be , " said elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you  
i knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them  
you know my mother ' s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends  
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety  
or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance  
in a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other  
" " when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other  
my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart  
and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last  
as a clergyman , moreover , i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence  
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night  
" " and do you really know all this ? " cried mrs gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive  
come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia ' s folly  
" " i have no right to give my opinion , " said wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise  
" " i think you said she was a widow , sir ? has she any family ? " " she has one only daughter , the heiress of rosings , and of very extensive property  
but sir william ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together  
unless you looked up to him as a superior  
and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery  
and , after half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure  
those who chose to be idle , certainly might  
" " pardon me for interrupting you , madam , " cried mr collins  
no one was to be put in competition with him  
" " yes , " replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but that was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance  
" " his pride , " said miss lucas , " does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it  
and so generous , that you will always exceed your income  
her answer was warmly in his favour  
those who do not complain are never pitied  
mr hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep  
mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away  
and mr bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " but is there not danger of lady catherine ' s disapprobation here , my good sir ? you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness  
let me advise you then , my dear sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence  
for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton , these visitors came  
it will not do  
nay , were your friend lady catherine to know me , i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation  
they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , every thing to him  
but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool ' s errand again  
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is  
and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his  
in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her  
" " now , kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said mr bennet  
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous  
you must send john with the young ladies , mrs collins  
" " perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh , " said elizabeth  
" " exceed their income ! my dear mr bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you talking of ? why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more  
and then you may say whatever you like of me  
these are conditions , which , considering every thing , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you  
" i do not know when i have been more shocked , " said she  
he is gone to my father already  
how wonderfully these sort of things occur ! who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly ! i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before  
and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress  
you see on what a footing we are  
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited  
but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this  
" " mr darcy is not to be laughed at ! " cried elizabeth  
and what is to divide them ? the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune  
" you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this  
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself  
and mrs bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter  
" " but upon my honour i do not  
and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced  
" " and your defect is a propensity to hate every body  
how mr darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell  
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity  
she was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle  
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent  
but consider how much it must increase his disappointment  
i hope we may often meet again  
mrs collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home  
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either  
having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy  
she was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung  
it cannot last long  
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas ' s last week  
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure  
" can this be mr darcy ! " thought she  
and their conversation , which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party  
" " certainly not  
we are all in an uproar  
and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her  
but really , and upon my honour , i will try to do what i think to be wisest  
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn  
people do not die of little trifling colds  
" " i cannot believe it  
" " my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents  
in a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account  
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out  
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it  
here , sarah , come to miss bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown  
" though it had not occurred to me before  
but she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents  
but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour  
contact the foundation as set forth in section <num> below  
let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied  
" " and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him  
and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her  
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards  
yet , indeed , i am in earnest  
" " do you suppose them to be in london ? " " yes  
and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it  
far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter  
the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr bingley from your sister , and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of mr wickham  
i rather wonder now at your knowing any  
shall i get you one ? you are very ill  
and will probably be much talked of  
it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise  
" they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him  
" i am by no means of opinion , i assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency  
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect  
and the others were to meet us at the church  
that speech savours strongly of disappointment  
&c  
not like the wild young men now a days , who think of nothing but themselves  
and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground  
" " yes  
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far  
anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil  
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it  
and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia ' s leaving home  
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other  
i could hardly keep my countenance  
" " indeed , mr collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary  
" " i am sorry you think so  
" " whatever i do is done in a hurry , " replied he  
who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! " " she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind  
" occupied in observing mr bingley ' s attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend  
since the shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head  
" to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia  
and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind  
i should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship  
" " upon my word ! well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know  
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends  
she was shewn into the breakfast parlour , where all but jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise  
his understanding and opinions all please me  
" mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted  
she felt it so  
to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment  
i did not know before , that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony  
" mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication  
there was too much to be thought  
he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party  
" " you have only proved by this , " cried elizabeth , " that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition  
" " oh ! yes , " said elizabeth drily " mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him  
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession  
" " well , then , you need not be under any alarm  
the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter  
i always said it must be so , at last  
she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne ' s  
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly  
what a fine thing for our girls ! " " how so ? how can it affect them ? " " my dear mr bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome ! you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them  
let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them  
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion  
if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him  
at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself  
" charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where mrs bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family  
" " did charlotte dine with you ? " " no , she would go home  
but i am sure i never saw any thing of it  
they went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her  
and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year  
i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : i like them prodigiously  
his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do  
at present , however , i consider myself as quite fixed here  
but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane ' s  
but do you always write such charming long letters to her , mr darcy ? " " they are generally long  
if the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem  
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane ' s happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring  
" when is your next ball to be , lizzy ? " " to morrow fortnight  
she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " there are very few people of whom so much can be said  
i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way  
i beg you will not go  
" " if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it  
" " and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , " added kitty  
" it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life  
" at that moment they were met from another walk , by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself  
" the introduction , however , was immediately made  
" " my dear mr bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother  
" " my mother would have had no objection , but my father hates london  
any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have been left as printed  
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information  
and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride  
" " if you mean darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing  
" " i thank you for my share of the favour , " said elizabeth  
be that as it may , she saw him go with regret  
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? " " will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? " " by all means , " cried bingley  
the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress  
or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house  
" " you must not blame my aunt  
" miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject  
" " it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said bingley  
thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business  
and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him  
and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you  
he had been some time with mr gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning  
he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily  
she was humbled , she was grieved  
i hope you have destroyed the letter  
his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go  
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies  
" indeed i have , sir , " was her answer  
" " your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you  
" " i dislike it very much , " he replied  
their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country  
human nature is so prone to fall into it ! no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame  
then , the two third he danced with miss king , and the two fourth with maria lucas , and the two fifth with jane again , and the two sixth with lizzy , and the boulanger " " if he had had any compassion for me , " cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much ! for god ' s sake , say no more of his partners  
" there is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? " the surprise of such an application was great indeed  
" " there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men  
see <url> transcriber ' s note : text enclosed by underscores is in italics ( italics ) 
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs f  
lizzy is not a bit better than the others  
she had instinctively turned away  
such formidable accounts of her ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened maria lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at st  
but i will no longer importune my young cousin  
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return  
" i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter ! " " la ! my dear , " said maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not lady catherine  
but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled  
miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before  
mrs bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else , for half an hour  
but without much success  
and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance  
" by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter  
when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible  
" what do you think ? it is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like  
bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed  
we have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve  
no one but mrs bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short  
" " i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us  
chapter ix  
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more  
without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object  
i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent  
but my dearest love , tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of , that i may have it to morrow  
" " yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever  
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least  
for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms  
you have delighted us long enough  
" " mr bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? you take delight in vexing me  
" pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried colonel fitzwilliam  
here was knowledge in which no one could partake  
and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love  
and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william ' s in his regimentals  
" do not you want to know who has taken it ? " cried his wife impatiently  
i do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain  
" good gracious ! lord bless me ! only think ! dear me ! mr darcy ! who would have thought it ! and is it really true ? oh ! my sweetest lizzy ! how rich and how great you will be ! what pin money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! jane ' s is nothing to it nothing at all  
" " he likes to have his own way very well , " replied colonel fitzwilliam  
but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy  
that the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny  
here you are in your own family  
he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible  
there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter , which promises well  
this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together  
to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery  
" " no " said darcy , " i have made no such pretension  
it was the last of the regiment ' s stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace  
and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys  
despite these efforts , project gutenberg tm electronic works , and the medium on which they may be stored , may contain " defects , " such as , but not limited to , incomplete , inaccurate or corrupt data , transcription errors , a copyright or other intellectual property infringement , a defective or damaged disk or other medium , a computer virus , or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment  
not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it  
at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance  
miss bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt  
" " that is very true , " said elizabeth  
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them  
" darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject  
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible  
they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve  
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham , and rejoiced in it  
" " and can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? " " i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship  
" " i dare say you believed it  
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more  
" " but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea  
that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son  
" " that will make your ladyship ' s situation at present more pitiable  
" she was gone directly  
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived  
they were all of them warm in their admiration  
" i am trying to make it out  
their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves  
you supposed more than really existed  
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own  
and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances  
she could think of nothing but of mr wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home  
their father was in neither  
when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent  
he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting  
" as soon as ever mr bingley comes , my dear , " said mrs bennet , " you will wait on him of course  
determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female  
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both  
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and the children  
and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave  
my visit was not long , as caroline and mrs hurst were going out  
and why not to me ? if he fears me , why come hither ? if he no longer cares for me , why silent ? teazing , teazing , man ! i will think no more about him  
" i began to be afraid you would never come back again  
mamma would like to go too of all things ! only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! " " yes , " thought elizabeth , " that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once  
her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much  
everything wore a happier aspect  
the family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them  
they walked on , without knowing in what direction  
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him  
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins  
nor did he seem much more at ease  
i thought him very sly  
mr collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society  
he shook his head when i expressed my hopes , and said he feared w  
" " no , lizzy , that is what i do not choose  
she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them  
" it was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on  
and was so good as to stay till thursday with me  
and now , i hope you are satisfied  
her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction  
" you have insulted me , in every possible method  
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? oh ! no  
" " our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money  
he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride  
elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight  
but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening  
mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet , and mrs hurst was observing their game  
i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes  
and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there  
" and this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend ' s anxious circumspection ! of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! " in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose  
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins , she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to mrs collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl  
mr bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house  
" yes if darcy does not put it off again  
from thence to the library  
will you come and see me ? " " we shall often meet , i hope , in hertfordshire  
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her  
it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome  
" " if it is designedly done , they cannot be justified  
and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness  
allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , ( glancing at her sister and bingley , ) shall take place  
and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater  
the children have been wanting me this half hour  
" " i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party  
" * * * * * the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great  
in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence  
i told mrs collins so before you came  
but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield  
" come , darcy , " said he , " i must have you dance  
it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect  
" he listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long  
in this danger kitty is also comprehended  
the world has been deceived in that respect  
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances : and to have mr collins instead ! her liveliness had been never worse timed  
but slyness seems the fashion  
" " i should like it beyond any thing ! " said her mother  
" that is all very proper and civil , i am sure , " said mrs bennet , " and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman  
she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success  
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing  
and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again  
by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain  
mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty  
nobody can tell what i suffer ! but it is always so  
" and pray what is the result ? " " i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect  
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you  
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first  
elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes  
but she was flattered and pleased  
perhaps i am not doing her justice  
you cannot have been always at longbourn  
its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of mr collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards herself  
but now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice  
she does not yet leave her dressing room  
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s ear  
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved  
for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous  
" " i do not at all know  
it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried  
mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend  
elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked  
pemberley was now georgiana ' s home  
she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there  
" to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew  
easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important  
" i am not a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things  
for in a quarter of an hour ' s tête à tête with mrs bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very jane he had fixed on  
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennet ' s ill humour or ill health  
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty  
and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected  
she was ashamed to think how much  
were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain  
he did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately  
" " upon my word , sir , " cried elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration  
his countenance rather gained in austerity  
" mrs bennet ' s eyes sparkled  
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly  
it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary  
my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken  
i came to try you  
" you forget that i have made no answer  
and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam ' s and mr darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former  
" but it is , " returned she  
their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham ' s extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them  
their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general  
they were in street  
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew  
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton  
her nose wants character  
they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight  
i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten  
though i doubt whether his reserve , or anybody'_ reserve , can be answerable for the event  
i had not an idea of it  
i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company  
daughters are never of so much consequence to a father  
you cannot refuse to dance , i am sure , when so much beauty is before you  
no one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection  
international donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states  
and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day  
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable  
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me  
i have done with you from this very day  
" " which do you mean ? " and turning round , he looked for a moment at elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " she is tolerable  
" this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer  
" my dear , dear aunt , " she rapturously cried , " what delight ! what felicity ! you give me fresh life and vigour  
" and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr collins thus addressed her , " when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me  
and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room  
lady catherine ' s great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of  
your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter  
" this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham ' s being among them  
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but mrs bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage  
elizabeth was excessively disappointed  
" " it is wonderful , " replied wickham , " for almost all his actions may be traced to pride  
ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination  
she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer  
it makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else  
you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me  
they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank  
" " nor i , i am sure , " said miss bingley  
at first  
and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected  
my father bears it better  
and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came  
mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction  
" he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away  
mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton  
" " and yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them  
she looked at jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns  
" i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle  
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers  
" " do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " " it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it  
when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing  
for while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on any one else  
" elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards  
i am sorry to say it of them , but so it is  
" " to oblige you , i would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this  
he seldom appeared really animated  
the part which i acted , is now to be explained  
more thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed  
the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised  
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed  
he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits  
when mr collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten  
" but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome  
for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all  
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it  
" mrs bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library  
for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible  
but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness  
she is almost three and twenty ! lord , how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty ! my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands , you can't think  
if it be not so , let mr darcy contradict it  
it is unaccountable ! in every view it is unaccountable ! " " my dear lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these  
i suppose you have heard of it  
i was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that miss elizabeth bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , mr darcy  
but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them  
and they pursued the accustomed circuit  
can he be a sensible man , sir ? " " no , my dear  
and of late it has been shifting about pretty much  
they will take care not to outrun their income  
did not i mention it to you ? mr robinson ' s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question oh ! the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point  
mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips  
" her father lifted up his eyes  
could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ? mr darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! it is admirable ! " elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile  
wont it , kitty ? " kitty owned that she had rather stay at home  
but i confess they would have no charms for me  
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them  
elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable  
that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head  
for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me  
" yes , she called yesterday with her father  
she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park  
" oh ! my dear lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? " " oh , lord ! i don't know  
he bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy , with an expression of half laughing alarm  
" i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places  
" " but not before they went to brighton ? " " no , i believe not  
" miss bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere  
do not distress me by the idea  
contributions to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by u  
but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her  
my youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who i believe will soon become a part of the family  
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day  
mrs bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could  
the loo table , however , did not appear  
" here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of  
she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you  
" " another time , lizzy , " said her mother , " i would not dance with him , if i were you  
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence  
and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia ' s flight , on her own folly alone  
you had much better dance  
i never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united  
darcy took up a book  
" " oh ! it is of no consequence  
and when you have given your ball , " she added , " i shall insist on their giving one also

whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure  
they met again on sunday , and then i saw him too  
names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony  
while these newly born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing  
and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure  
" " true , " said mr bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it  
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins  
" and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house  
and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and mrs long  
and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached  
and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered  
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together  
dear , dear lizzy  
and mr collins was to attend them , at the request of mr bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself  
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal  
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her  
they were not the only objects of mr collins ' s admiration  
pray forgive me , if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from p  
and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town  
" " and do you like her ? " " very much  
and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way  
" oh ! mary , " said she , " i wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along , kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach  
what are men to rocks and mountains ? oh ! what hours of transport we shall spend ! and when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing  
" " i might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? was not this some excuse for incivility , if i was uncivil ? but i have other provocations  
he found her as handsome as she had been last year  
" elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required  
but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected  
it cannot be done too much  
the communication excited many professions of concern  
darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence  
and , if i may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses  
" some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from longbourn would come in the evening  
" " perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson  
i cannot think so very ill of wickham  
my temper i dare not vouch for  
" " perhaps we might be deceived  
she assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her  
every sister except mary agreed to go with her  
but i know the foundation is unjust  
" she replied , endeavouring to recover herself  
but with the rich , he is liberal minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure  
you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself  
she is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest  
" " and this is your real opinion ! this is your final resolve ! very well  
the invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine ' s drawing room  
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane  
i was only confused for the moment , because i felt that i should be looked at  
" catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer  
i saw them the night before last  
" " if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there  
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace  
" " but people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever  
i cannot understand it  
chapter viii  
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly  
" it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single  
he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father ' s intentions

but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them  
" " who do you mean , my dear ? i know of nobody that is coming i am sure , unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in , and i hope my dinners are good enough for her  
it seems but a fortnight i declare  
jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation  
" miss bingley made no answer  
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met  
my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible  
miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy , her sister scarcely less so  
he placed himself by her  
and who knows what may happen ? but that is nothing to us  
thank heaven ! he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves  
" " had you then persuaded yourself that i should ? " " indeed i had  
mrs bennet ' s best comfort was , that mr bingley must be down again in the summer  
but we are all liable to error  
wholly inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one ' s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever  
" " it is not mr bingley , " said her husband  
he was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey  
her ease and good spirits increased  
" " i am afraid you do not like your pen  
but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas ' s  
" " if we thought alike of miss bingley , " replied jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy  
" and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit  
i thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town  
he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce  
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again

" during their walk , it was resolved that mr bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening  
she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage  
his sisters declared that they were miserable  
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit  
and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter  
" " neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance  
he was well , but so much engaged with mr darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him  
the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people ! what would i give to hear your strictures on them ! " " your conjecture is totally wrong , i assure you  
" " she will drop the acquaintance entirely  
but gracious me ! i quite forgot ! i ought not to have said a word about it  
at length , every idea seemed to fail him  
mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance  
a house in town ! every thing that is charming ! three daughters married ! ten thousand a year ! oh , lord ! what will become of me  
i will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as i can , or , perhaps , i may defer it , till kitty runs away  
she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable  
kitty was the only one who shed tears  
i wish i could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that i despair  
bingley was punctual to his appointment  
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other  
poor charlotte ! it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! but she had chosen it with her eyes open  
when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other  
it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture  
his fear of her , has always operated , i know , when they were together  
wickham is safe  
" " a little sea bathing would set me up for ever  
" elizabeth made no answer  
" " well , " said charlotte , " i wish jane success with all my heart  
what i have to say relates to poor lydia  
but here he was set right by mrs bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen  
" " but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said jane  
but ashworth is too far off ! i could not bear to have her ten miles from me  
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his  
and the other , how i am ever to pay him  
nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural  
and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter  
on his side even more  
and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married  
just enough to make one good sort of man  
but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant ' s commission in the shire  
but , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ' s  
good bye  
these causes must be stated , though briefly  
she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body  
" i hope , my dear , " said mr bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to day , because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party  
though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole  
redistribution is subject to the trademark license , especially commercial redistribution  
and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation  
lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath  
and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone  
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds  
it is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which i am now complaining  
" " but if you have got them to day , " said elizabeth , " my mother ' s purpose will be answered  
do you draw ? " " no , not at all  
i congratulate her  
when the ladies returned to the drawing room , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted  
i am perfectly serious in my refusal  
i knew how it would be  
she shall hear my opinion  
" " miss bennet , do you know who i am ? i have not been accustomed to such language as this  
she had been unwilling to mention bingley  
and she sat down directly to the instrument  
" we can all plague and punish one another  
she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge  
she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes  
mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit  
" he is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively  
not that i mean to find fault with you , for such things i know are all chance in this world  
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others  
you wanted me , i know , to say 'yes ,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste  
" wickham only shook his head

elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia  
" read it aloud , " said their father , " for i hardly know myself what it is about  
four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means  
" lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her  
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention  
he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on  
" don't keep coughing so , kitty , for heaven ' s sake ! have a little compassion on my nerves  
it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr darcy ! it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon  
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing  
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s corroboration  
soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet  
from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him  
federal laws and your state ' s laws  
" " but you forget , mama , " said elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that mrs long has promised to introduce him  
when i last saw her , she was not very promising  
as long as she stays there , it is all very well  
and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification  
" to jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection  
" elizabeth felt herself completely taken in  
and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room  
and therefore checked her laugh  
" " i have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two  
for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before  
talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife  
gardiner  
he knows where we live  
she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence  
" " that is a failing indeed ! " cried elizabeth  
the party did not supply much conversation  
it was the second week in may , in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street , for the town of in hertfordshire  
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants  
" nothing that she could say , however , had any influence  
" " i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him , i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this ! " after a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " i do remember his boasting one day , at netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper  
" " i see no occasion for that  
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it  
i thought i should have broke my heart  
elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ' s thoughts , now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away  
but you are always giving her the preference  
after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud  
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence  
one meets it every where  
there could not exist in the world two men , over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influence  
well , but now for my news : it is about dear wickham  
" but it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded  
her power was sinking  
i want to talk very seriously  
take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one  
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin  
i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen  
they have at least that advantage  
it is what every body says  
for mine is totally different  
but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and mr darcy appeared  
her astonishment , however , was extreme  
my father , however , is partial to mr wickham  
they had long wished to see him  
but as he took up his abode with the lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet  
she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it  
so far we are equal  
i hope there was  
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house  
" " ah ! " cried mrs bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls  
this was one point , with regard to lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and mr bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him  
" " have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? " " oh ! yes  
and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding  
but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success  
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy ' s meditated elopement  
" from what we have seen of him , " continued mrs gardiner , " i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham  
" " i should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner  
" kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room  
the more i see of the world , the more am i dissatisfied with it  
chapter xii  
and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either  
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire  
and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do  
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine  
all field sports were over  
elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from pemberley  
" every body was surprised  
and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters  
and perhaps he might be doing the same  
for a few minutes he was silent  
" " we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , " said elizabeth  
but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular  
" " it is amazing to me , " said bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are  
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , flowing hand  
chapter xxii  
" elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling  
" lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind  
" i never heard any thing so abominable  
but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit  
his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind  
if this be the case , he deserves you  
but if we do not venture , somebody else will

she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more  
" " what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ? for , though your accusations were ill founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof  
each of them deep in thought  
" " no more have i , " said mr bennet  
and on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " the men shan't come and part us , i am determined  
what will you think of my vanity ? i believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses  
it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago  
but her letters were always long expected , and always very short  
he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther  
my father began life in the profession which your uncle , mr philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property  
we will go round the park every day  
do your sisters play and sing ? " " one of them does  
she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together  
the officers may not be so pleasant in general 's regiment  
she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations  
though her manner varied however , her determination never did  
the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and lady catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging  
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging  
and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent  
you never see a fault in any body  
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur  
and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day  
and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection  
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley , " i can guess the subject of your reverie  
nor did that day wear out her resentment  
he did every thing best in the world  
his letter was soon dispatched  
" " i am exceedingly gratified , " said bingley , " by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper  
they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature  
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference  
and in farther justification of mr darcy , she could not but allow that mr bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair  
every body said how well she looked  
hope was over , entirely over  
but however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so  
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ? " elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here  
till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happiness  
secondly , she was very sure that mr collins had been taken in  
" it is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country  
" as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood  
" we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said mrs gardiner , " but perhaps to the lakes  
" " and so was i  
nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation  
but i will not repine  
" to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust  
if that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon  
" " i am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly  
and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side  
" " what is it you mean ? " " it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ' s family , it would be an unpleasant thing  
" elizabeth was distressed  
" elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing  
" oh ! yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well , and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again  
no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed  
" " poor wickham  
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , i cannot tell  
and he might imagine , from my father ' s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter  
" elizabeth answered only by a slight bow  
chapter ii  
and when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether  
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately  
that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done  
mrs bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast  
<num> of la belle assemblee <num>^{st} july <num>_ ] pride & prejudice  
and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned  
but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all  
the discussion of mr collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother  
and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness  
it will save me a world of trouble and economy  
" " and this , " cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me ! this is the estimation in which you hold me ! i thank you for explaining it so fully  
and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand  
when she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation  
" is it not clear enough ? does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister  
but i can guess how it was  
a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is  
things are settled so oddly  
as for their mother , mr collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters  
but their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them  
" " we are speaking of music , madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply  
" and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you  
" " dear madam , " cried mrs hill , in great astonishment , " don't you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner ? he has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter  
" in essentials , i believe , he is very much what he ever was  
" sure he will not leave london before he has found them  
<num> 
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them  
" " your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family , " said elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it  
" " you have said quite enough , madam  
his consenting to marry her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking  
it was evident that he was very much in love with her  
the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town  
the others have been gone on to scarborough , these three weeks  
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley , and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well  
her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object  
i must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music  
but these things happen so often ! a young man , such as you describe mr bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent  
the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me  
but she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies  
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor  
" elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce  
pray , how violent _ mr bingley ' s love ? " " i never saw a more promising inclination  
but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked  
one must speak a little , you know  
i was right , therefore  
as a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me  
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility  
i believe i have now told you every thing  
but no , " recollecting herself , " that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : i should not have been allowed to invite them  
but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them  
and no less certain is it , that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it  
she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression  
and their mother talked on , of her dislike of mr darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them  
" " insolent girl ! " said elizabeth to herself  
but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years  
had it been your uncle ' s doing , i must and would have paid him  
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general  
" " that is to say , you had given your permission  
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements  
elizabeth went away with her head full of him  
" chapter v  
elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together  
" " all ! what , all five out at once ? very odd ! and you only the second  
she saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers  
" " i did not know before , " continued bingley immediately , " that you were a studier of character  
she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him  
but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her  
at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do  
and yet , upon my honour , i believed what i said of myself to be true , and i believe it at this moment  
do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg tm license terms from this work , or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with project gutenberg tm  
" " good heavens ! " cried elizabeth  
but what could set you off in the first place ? " " i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation  
jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears  
and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances  
as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer  
my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself  
his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes  
their mutual affection will steady them  
when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen  
and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself  
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection  
mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless  
if there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence  
sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise  
and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body  
the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment  
" " unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do  
<num> 
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence  
" he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr collins ' s letter  
" you write uncommonly fast  
indeed he has no improper pride  
mr darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me  
" " yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight  
my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour  
" " and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley  
" lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ? are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? have not you always hated him ? " how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give  
my daughters are brought up differently  
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him  
" this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away  
her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening ' s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment  
though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to you  
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation  
" she cried  
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly  
at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family  
and be ready to believe , for every body ' s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin  
" elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak  
but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence  
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother  
and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required  
what he told me was merely this  
his character is thereby complete  
but that is what a governess will prevent , and if i had known your mother , i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one  
it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration  
" are you not diverted ? " " oh ! yes  
" you excel so much in the dance , miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you  
but with such a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no chance of it  
your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice  
and in the evening mrs bennet ' s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter  
" how nicely we are crammed in ! " cried lydia  
" " in point of composition , " said mary , " his letter does not seem defective  
but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal  
and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite  
he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation  
my reasons for believing it are briefly these : it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable  
it cannot be concealed from any one  
when the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist  
i do not deserve it  
i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere  
but we considered it , we talked of it as impossible  
for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible  
" " and so ended his affection , " said elizabeth impatiently  
" " she had better have stayed at home , " cried elizabeth  
this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed  
the comfort to her , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression  
sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion  
and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity  
bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time  
and from this time mr bingley ' s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them  
they are certainly not gone to scotland  
" " and what is fifty miles of good road ? little more than half a day ' s journey  
" " you are quite right  
" " and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " " my father is gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle ' s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , i hope , in half an hour  
every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room  
" it is a long time , mr bingley , since you went away , " said mrs bennet  
it was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long  
he immediately offered to fetch her others  
her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it  
" indeed , you are mistaken , madam  
james ' s  
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him  
with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand  
i do not trust my own partiality  
" " i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these  
and what sort of young lady is she ? is she handsome ? " " she is a most charming young lady indeed  
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments  
but so we all were  
it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment  
that lady i suppose is your mother  
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more  
" miss bennet paused a little and then replied , " surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully  
he carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity  
" and upon elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " lizzy , i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins  
" " she is a very good kind of girl , i believe  
both sisters were uncomfortable enough  
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? she supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter  
" and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr darcy  
" she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door  
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on  
once or twice she could discern a faint blush  
and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted  
" well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " what say you to the day ? i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you  
" " you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters  
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day  
in the hall they parted  
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life  
nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece  
one i will not mention  
" when the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed  
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl  
his character sunk on every review of it  
i never saw such a long chin in my life  
she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents  
i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind  
mr collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed  
" and with a bow to mr darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room  
and sleeping one night on the road , reached longbourn by dinner time the next day  
but why did not you tell me so before ? if i had known as much this morning , i certainly would not have called on him  
jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " oh , papa , what news ? what news ? have you heard from my uncle ? " " yes , i have had a letter from him by express  
and for the first evening she was his settled choice  
good gracious ! when i went away , i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again ! though i thought it would be very good fun if i was  
" i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning  
lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford  
i think i have heard you say that you know them  
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her  
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former  
before any answer could arrive from mr collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth , from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge  
by the author of " sense and sensibility  
mary would not understand them  
" fitzwilliam darcy  
" the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable  
" " i will not be interrupted  
made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission ! so much the better  
and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all  
mr collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr darcy ' s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way  
i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject  
" " i like her appearance , " said elizabeth , struck with other ideas  
" " all young ladies accomplished ! my dear charles , what do you mean ? " " yes , all of them , i think  
long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided  
but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means  
and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary  
you are charmingly group'd , and appear to uncommon advantage  
" " la ! you are so strange ! but i must tell you how it went off  
in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam  
at that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion  
but it had not been so in derbyshire  
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this  
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything  
" he paused in hopes of an answer  
they are gone off together from brighton  
chapter xxiii  
she was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one ' s approach  
and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too  
intending to trace their route  
mr collins ' s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs bennet  
i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy  
after playing some italian songs , miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air  
elizabeth soon heard from her friend  
when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever  
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg tm license as specified in paragraph <num> 
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery  
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance  
" it was the prospect of constant society , and good society , " he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the shire  
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them  
but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas  
i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you  
they must all go to brighton  
he heard her attentively , and then said , " lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances  
wickham ' s affection for lydia , was just what elizabeth had expected to find it  
" " i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it  
" " but my father cannot  
he replied , and was again silent  
" " you mistake me , my dear  
dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship ' s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give  
for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them  
" " that is very strange  
his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad  
for on first hearing it , mrs bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable  
that is all to be forgot  
" you certainly do , " she replied with a smile  
and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart  
to pemberley , therefore , they were to go  
" " oh , yes  
but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry  
at present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood  
but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library , ) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels  
there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper  
but the gloom of lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away  
he comes down on thursday at the latest , very likely on wednesday  
and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs bennet ' s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away  
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began  
whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr darcy approaching them , and at no great distance  
" " miss elizabeth bennet ! " repeated miss bingley  
and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations

" " elizabeth , you are not serious now  
mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper  
and i know i appeared distressed  
his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire  
" " i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do  
you blamed me for coming ? " " no indeed  
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself  
the officers will find women better worth their notice  
give me farther particulars  
and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented  
and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time  
i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you  
at length the parsonage was discernible  
but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent  
there is but such a quantity of merit between them  
and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ? did she call to refuse her consent ? " to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh  
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy  
but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line  
as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr darcy , and mr darcy only , entered the room  
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them  
that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match  
" " and quite alone ? have all her friends left her ? " " mrs annesley is with her  
" " what think you of books ? " said he , smiling  
it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution  
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves  
she was aware that no one liked him but jane  
i  
i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well informed woman for the rest of her life  
" it certainly is a most iniquitous affair , " said mr bennet , " and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn  
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish  
i must be in town next saturday  
" did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? " " from the former  
" not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs bennet give up the point  
and without any intention of coming back again  
and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment  
her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world ! how strange must it appear to him ! in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! oh ! why did she come ? or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage  
elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her  
her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself  
" elizabeth was forced to go  
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed : but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this  
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom  
mr collins was eloquent in her praise  
she was engaged one day as she walked , in re perusing jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her  
" i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement  
and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome

multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets ( example : m^{rs} ) 
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word  
elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy , and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it  
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable  
he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him  
at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction  
in that case he would return no more  
and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london , than in scotland  
elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect  
" most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote  
see <num> h  
after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to mr and mrs gardiner , though unknown  
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did  
to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected  
if you'll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight  
i have not forgot , you see  
her fellow travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable  
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude  
but their astonishment was beyond their expectation  
and the possibility of her deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret  
i was sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her  
" the first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them  
which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read  
there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning  
" " but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied darcy  
" for my own part , " she rejoined , " i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her  
elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend  
" he must be an oddity , i think , " said she  
but now we may be silent  
the second began  
a most delightful place ! excellent parsonage house ! it would have suited me in every respect  
jane resolutely kept her place at the table  
" " and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason  
but it is of small importance  
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good  
miss bingley ' s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for jane  
but to say the truth , i was too cross to write  
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true  
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted  
he is come mr bingley is come  
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia  
" elizabeth quietly answered " undoubtedly  
and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together  
widely different was the effect of a second perusal  
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it  
and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected  
his pride never deserts him  
when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " by the bye , charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield ? i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party  
it was all pride and insolence  
its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet  
and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces  
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough  
" i admire all my three sons in law highly , " said he  
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters  
and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress  
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information  
how does georgiana get on , darcy ? " mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s proficiency  
for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him  
and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation  
and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self importance and humility  
and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp  
the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father  
elizabeth ' s courage did not fail her  
when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room  
" chapter vii  
one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to elizabeth , " lizzy , i never gave you an account of my wedding , i believe  
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable  
i do not believe she often sees such at home  
till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger  
and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone  
" " they have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he  
" " i have been making the tour of the park , " he replied , " as i generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage  
" " your plan is a good one , " replied elizabeth , " where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married  
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession  
it is highly improper  
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did january and february pass away  
" " as often as i can  
in as short a time as mr collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both  
" indeed , jane , you ought to believe me  
my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed ! but perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design  
colonel fitzwilliam ' s occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her  
his pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by  
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes  
from the entrance hall , of which mr collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti chamber , to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and mrs jenkinson were sitting  
bingley is most unaffectedly modest  
" my dear friend , " if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day ' s tête à tête between two women can never end without a quarrel  
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament  
at present i am not in love with mr wickham  
" when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense  
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out  
it is because he will not give himself the trouble  
since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design  
a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade  
but are you pleased , jane ? shall you like to have such a brother ? " " very , very much  
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers  
" " if you believed it impossible to be true , " said elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far  
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets  
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him  
but intricate characters are the most amusing  
they were able to love each other , even as well as they intended  
find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit her  
all that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the london road  
she had always seen it with pain  
his friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in ten days time  
she related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain  
the path just admitted three  
i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise  
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate  
" hunsford , near westerham , kent , <num>th october  
but if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away  
" and that i suppose is one of your sisters  
" " laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion  
i wish you had been there  
" my dear niece , " i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you  
" i wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer  
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth  
you have sense , and we all expect you to use it  
much as i respect them , i believe , i thought only of you  
she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought  
jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them  
and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of kitty ' s and lydia ' s purchases , were seated in it  
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical  
lizzy declares she will not have mr collins , and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy  
" the girls stared at their father  
they were , therefore , to go  
its completion depended on others  
kitty stared at him , and lydia exclaimed  
" mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand  
my dear jane , mr collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow minded , silly man  
" " you have a house in town , i conclude ? " mr darcy bowed  
" " of whom does jane ever think ill ? and who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is  
" " your first position is false  
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long  
" but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery  
how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family ! when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful  
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that i am not afraid of requesting it , though i have still something more to ask of the former  
" " gracechurch street , monday , august <num> 
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states  
" " let me be rightly understood  
he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane  
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , diffused over his face , became him  
she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them  
it must be an amusing study  
and within five miles of lambton , elizabeth found from her aunt , that pemberley was situated  
two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole  
but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it  
" but it is wholly out of my power  
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory  
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal  
" " i can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me  
bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the principal object  
for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot  
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball  
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent  
which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend  
" yours , &c  
but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved  
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley  
but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw mr darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister  
and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante  
he really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger  
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book  
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth ' s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty  
i thought it would never be over  
her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms  
i have suspected it some time , but i am now convinced  
" " i have heard much of your master ' s fine person , " said mrs gardiner , looking at the picture  
she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent  
" aye , there she comes , " continued mrs bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way  
" " it is more than i engage for , i assure you  
but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour  
it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason  
so easy , that every servant will cheat you  
mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love  
to the rest of the family they paid little attention  
but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited  
and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out  
but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant  
she sees them now very often standing in clarke ' s library  
he never saw him till the other morning at meryton  
and when it closed , elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well  
and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief  
i only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it  
" she did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go  
but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read  
remember that she is one of a large family  
on this point she was soon satisfied  
made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it  
you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention  
" " she is a very fine looking woman ! and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well  
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each  
he was my godfather , and excessively attached to me  
therefore , stay quietly at longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care  
but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know  
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home , and see if i can make it up any better  
the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all miss bingley ' s witticisms on fine _  
and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard  
" after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant , there chanced to be a little alteration  
i should say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has several  
" i know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but i shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life " mrs philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason  
but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year  
yes , miss bennet , interest  
i felt nothing but surprise  
darcy , after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing  
" elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart  
but who was your mother ? who are your uncles and aunts ? do not imagine me ignorant of their condition  
but at length was reduced to be reasonable  
she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening  
" to catherine and lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting  
by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary  
have you never happened to see her there ? " she was perfectly sensible that he never had  
and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon  
to the young ladies he certainly was nothing  
and if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london , for i am going there early in june , for a week  
i have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with  
had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her  
mr bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him  
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while  
my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case  
and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant  
well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done  
that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him  
to the little town of lambton , the scene of mrs gardiner ' s former residence , and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained , they bent their steps , after having seen all the principal wonders of the country  
and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once  
" his father was an excellent man , " said mrs gardiner  
and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane  
and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange  
and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose ? poor reynolds , she was always very fond of me  
his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family  
mr bingley was good looking and gentleman like  
is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ? a glass of wine  
" " if your master would marry , you might see more of him  
each felt for the other , and of course for themselves  
but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger  
in three volumes  
to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not  
his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature  
and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it  
" " but , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , i am sure  
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs  
in talking over their route the evening before , mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again  
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth

i was very uncomfortable , i may say unhappy  
" " you are mistaken  
they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds  
but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it  
" " i would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried bingley , " for a kingdom ! upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as i have this evening  
and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there  
he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear  
" " but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out  
but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father  
it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street  
" i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that  
" " i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression  
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last  
" " your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said darcy , " has too much truth  
" " from mr collins ! and what can he have to say ? " " something very much to the purpose of course  
mrs hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently mr darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her  
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing  
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy  
" good gracious ! " cried maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! " " a great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh  
lady catherine then observed , " your father ' s estate is entailed on mr collins , i think  
and she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at pemberley  
but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself  
they are all for what they can get  
but georgiana would not join her  
<num> 
and elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages  
but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield  
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " it is your turn to say something now , mr darcy  
<num> 
but with him i believe it does not often happen  
and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure  
they were of course all intending to be surprised  
mr darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her  
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic  
he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed  
he was on one side of her mother  
i am prodigiously proud of him  
the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity  
and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband  
" and gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when elizabeth called out , " dear ma'am , do not go  
mr darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart  
her mind was less difficult to develope  
but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply  
elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them  
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life  
you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters  
for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained  
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road  
" " how strange ! " cried elizabeth  
and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination  
" for mrs long has just been here , and she told me all about it  
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this  
as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs bennet followed her , saying , " i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself  
but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more i think than last year  
till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance  
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd

all that his library afforded  
but , really , i know not what to say  
poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment  
and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body  
for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as i could  
and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire  
our authority was too good  
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be  
every body is disgusted with his pride  
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield  
compliments always take you by surprise , and me never  
i am very , very sorry  
but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away  
your tempers are by no means unlike  
and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear  
mrs bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph  
my sister , i am sure , will not hear of her removal  
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister  
but in general charlotte wisely did not hear  
at that moment , she cared for no other  
what made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? " " because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement  
" the effect was immediate  
the turning past , he was immediately before them  
and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction  
and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of kitty  
mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty  
and mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings  
it is mr wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars  
" so , lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love i find  
" " she seems a very pleasant young woman , " said bingley  
" i told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy  
<num> 
how humiliating is this discovery ! yet , how just a humiliation ! had i been in love , i could not have been more wretchedly blind  
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long  
and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr bingley , was incomprehensible  
mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , &c  
he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again  
" " nay , if you are so serious about it , i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled  
" i hope , " added mrs gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her  
mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party  
" " i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , " cried elizabeth  
and their mother ' s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his

" she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted  
" " upon my word , caroline , i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation  
how is such a man to be worked on ? how are they even to be discovered ? i have not the smallest hope  
" " and that is quite impossible  
for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him , i should only think worse of her understanding , than i now do of her heart  
but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own  
and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation  
and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement  
and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent  
mr darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding  
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers  
till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante

did you admire me for my impertinence ? " " for the liveliness of your mind , i did  
i was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit  
lady lucas herself has often said so , and envied me jane ' s beauty  
elizabeth , equally next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course  
" perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one ' s neighbours  
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character  
i mend pens remarkably well  
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females  
" " but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow  
when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister  
for , of course , they were to have a son  
<num> 
say that urgent business calls us home immediately  
and lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world  
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother ' s in sending it  
that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance  
jane was beyond competition her favourite child  
" this information made elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor miss bingley  
" on reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below  
" " no , no  
in a few minutes , mrs bennet half opened the door and called out , " lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you  
we passed each other several times  
you must contrive to send somebody  
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband  
our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself  
perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice  
the horses were post  
was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth  
how i long to see her ! and to see dear wickham too ! but the clothes , the wedding clothes ! i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly  
" " lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home  
i know it all  
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collins ' s side , and as many bows on sir william ' s , they departed  
but let me advise you to think better of it  
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all  
which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts  
" " you may depend upon it , madam , " said miss bingley , with cold civility , " that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us  
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there

i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies  
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends  
but when they see , as i trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again  
" elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit  
it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately  
he has more to give  
after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , " is not this nice ? is not this an agreeable surprise ? " " and we mean to treat you all , " added lydia  
" you may well be surprised , miss bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday  
and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark  
and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself  
it would have been strange if they had  
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over  
when we met at pemberley  
why was he to be the judge ? " " you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? " " i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy  
" " and my mother how is she ? how are you all ? " " my mother is tolerably well , i trust  
but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book  
you will be a very happy woman  
but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph  
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone  
" " now i have got some news for you , " said lydia , as they sat down to table  
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him  
and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at pemberley  
and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed  
" " thank you but i always mend my own  
his apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else  
are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? " " no really , " replied elizabeth  
" i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness  
there was another reason too for her opposition  
and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments  
" " write to me very often , my dear  
i can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side  
your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why i come  
but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! the quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! but it was not to be

" " i should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill tempered man  
i hoped to find you reasonable  
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great  
women fancy admiration means more than it does  
and , turning to elizabeth , said , " miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room  
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters , elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day

but every body is to judge for themselves , and the lucases are very good sort of girls , i assure you  
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling  
by mrs hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey  
no , i certainly am not  
as they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions  
perhaps there was some truth in this  
bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever  
make haste , make haste  
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband  
such a disappointment ! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! it is really too distressing  
it was agreed to  
it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips  
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself  
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him  
" dear sir , " i must trouble you once more for congratulations  
" and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident  
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments  
but to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character ! i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes  
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters  
you do not look well  
elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william ' s too long  
and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty  
" but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing  
and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed  
it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world  
" " and mary king is safe ! " added elizabeth  
but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another _ in the affair  
it was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject  
it does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours  
" wickham , perhaps , is my favourite  
he had rather hoped that all his wife ' s views on the stranger would be disappointed  
every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to charlotte ' s first sketch  
i have a warm , unguarded temper , and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely  
to mr bennet ' s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family  
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening  
jane certainly could not come back  
chapter xv  
" " oh , well ! it is just as he chooses  
if i have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was unknowingly done  
and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern  
the distance is nothing , when one has a motive  
from elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent  
and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball  
and what do you think she said besides ? 'ah ! mrs bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last  
they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself  
let me mend it for you  
" elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme  
" this roused a general astonishment  
good girl ! it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingley ' s pretended regard  
" e  
" well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " i have no more to say  
they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them  
to own the truth , with wickham ! imagine our surprise  
on distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities  
you have done all this ! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule  
my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me  
for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner  
he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement  
what a delightful library you have at pemberley , mr darcy ! " " it ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many generations  
he added , that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave london , and promised to write again very soon  
she longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say  
you know my sentiments  
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited  
her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way  
" the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days  
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , i am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before  
pray do not talk of that odious man  
and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away  
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re establish a character  
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink  
" oh , jane , take care  
" i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia , " said she , " though i am not her particular friend  
she answered him in the usual way , and after a moment ' s pause , added , " my eldest sister has been in town these three months  
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be  
" " i am not going to run away , papa , " said kitty , fretfully  
you know i have  
her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy  
<num> 
" " thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me  
" good heaven ! can it be really so ! yet now i must believe you , " cried jane  
the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them  
a person may be proud without being vain  
they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn  
the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs forster , the delight of mrs bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described  
" but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer  
but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her  
" " there is some sense in what he says about the girls however  
" " and they must marry ! yet he is such a man ! " " yes , yes , they must marry  
come , kitty , i want you up stairs  
" " my dear , " replied her husband , " i have two small favours to request  
how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd ! yet it did , and even a third  
and so , is it quite certain he is coming ? " " you may depend on it , " replied the other , " for mrs nicholls was in meryton last night  
what a contrast between him and his friend ! mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party  
no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation  
" " in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure , " said bingley  
charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard  
when the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to elizabeth , " do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel  
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all  
and you cannot imagine how well he looked ! when denny , and wickham , and pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least  
see paragraph <num> 
but however he did not  
the other is miss de bourgh  
and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time  
we may compare our different opinions  
" elizabeth replied very concisely that she was  
though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak  
and tell my dear lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses  
for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation  
till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her  
had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged  
he had felt their importance in the family circle  
lady catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew  
i have not been used to submit to any person ' s whims  
" lady catherine de bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately given him a living  
" you want to tell me , and i have no objection to hearing it  
" " the person of whom i speak , is a gentleman and a stranger  
elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him  
after making every possible enquiry on that side london , colonel f  
and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme  
lord ! how i laughed ! and so did mrs forster  
he had looked at her without admiration at the ball  
" " with all my heart  
stay , stay , i will go myself  
" you are a good girl  
" after many pauses and many trials of other subjects , elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying , " i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley ! how can mr bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? how can they suit each other ? do you know mr bingley ? " " not at all  
the advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely  
" they are all silly and ignorant like other girls  
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town  
* * * * * transcriber ' s note : spelling and hyphen changes have been made so that there is consistency within the book  
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks  
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply  
that he is to take possession before michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week  
certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as i was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man  
however , i recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr darcy might have done as well  
and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance  
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand  
these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce  
" my mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at easter , i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh , widow of sir lewis de bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england  
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ' s  
that it should be equally unreserved was impossible  
and mrs hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother ' s conversation with miss bennet  
" " very true  
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand  
maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder  
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park  
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within  
she felt anew the justice of mr darcy ' s objections  
" elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise  
perhaps she is full young to be much in company  
" " if you will thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone  
if he were so , they could not succeed  
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience  
or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour  
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage  
when first mr bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless  
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing ' s park , when he put his letter into her hand ! she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it  
my last letter had never reached her  
as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was  
but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her  
" " take care , lizzy  
which will not be yours till after your mother ' s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to  
mr bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy  
it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want  

both changed colour , one looked white , the other red  
other schemes too came into her head  
the present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary  
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness  
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper  
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford  
we had better go into the avenue  
" this is an evening of wonders , indeed ! and so , darcy did every thing  
royalty payments must be paid within <num> days following each date on which you prepare ( or are legally required to prepare ) your periodic tax returns  
now be sincere  
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble  
those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable  
she got up , and ran out of the room  
yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet  
yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of  
" you are quite a visit in my debt , mr bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned  
it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it  
she had very little notice from any but him  
but no one can throw any blame on them  
" " lizzy , " said her father , " i have given him my consent  
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest , but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering  
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede  
you comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of project gutenberg tm works  
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the north  
" but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it  
she could not bear such suspense  
" " my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not  
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of  
your ' s , very sincerely , " m  
what it contains , has surprised me a good deal  
but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided  
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood  
i will go directly to mr bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure  
his anxiety for jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others  
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly  
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiner ' s curiosity  
her voice was weak , and her manner affected  
they had not been long together , before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her  
and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly  
has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " " your ladyship has declared it to be impossible  
" " the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so  
but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it  
with the gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms  
" " money ! my uncle ! " cried jane , " what do you mean , sir ? " " i mean , that no man in his senses , would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after i am gone  
we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine  
the compliment must be all for herself  
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed  
but not handsome enough to tempt me  
into one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance  
when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match  
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? " " why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear  
at least , therefore , i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies  
and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be  
" what can be the meaning of this ! " said charlotte , as soon as he was gone  
but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to  
mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received  
it is too long ago  
" mrs gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of jane and elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation  
when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings  
it was over at last however  
but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , " i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to ask  
i am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me  
oh ! lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall i bear so much happiness ! " she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty  
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent  
four weeks passed away , and jane saw nothing of him  
but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme  
his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it  
if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham , you must be very happy  
and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world  
" but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation  
when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music  
" " a man who had felt less , might  
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here  
" " oh ! do not repeat what i then said  
" " i have not a doubt of mr bingley ' s sincerity , " said elizabeth warmly  
" mr bingley arrived  
her carriage remained at the door , and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it  
i will put on my things in a moment  
" " and of your infliction , " cried elizabeth with energy  
" when i consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that i might have prevented it ! i who knew what he was  
its effect was most extraordinary  
she saw instantly that her cousin ' s manners were not altered by his marriage  
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy  
" " pray tell your sister that i long to see her  
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham  
it was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills  
from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day  
" if one could but go to brighton ! " observed mrs bennet  
every park has its beauty and its prospects  
and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding your ' s  
though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother  
i am not romantic you know  
" " you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy ? " " indeed i am  
as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits  
he merely answered her question , and read on  
as they went down stairs together , charlotte said , " i shall depend on hearing from you very often , eliza  
unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only child ) i was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own  
" " this is not to be borne  
i am afraid you will be angry  
no thanks to his gallantry for that  
there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance  
for about three years i heard little of him  
and it is that which makes the wonder  
dear me ! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster ' s  
" the picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed rooms , were all that remained to be shewn  
" in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " i take no leave of you , miss bennet  
she is not acting by design  
eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress  
" said her sister  
they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved  
" and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out  
and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it  
lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention  
she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins  
her features , though not plain , were insignificant  
such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them  
she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks  
a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing  
" it taught me to hope , " said he , " as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before  
but is it certain , absolutely certain ? " " oh yes ! they left brighton together on sunday night , and were traced almost to london , but not beyond  
you know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it  
" mr bennet ' s expectations were fully answered  
" " not the slightest  
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of  
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance  
about the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon  
they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene  
" " my dear aunt , this is being serious indeed  
it was gratitude  
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight  
" this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make  
i dearly love a laugh  
yes , yes  
i often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice  
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! " " i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love , " said darcy  
he was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere  
and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close  
jane was not happy  
" " are they indeed ? " cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction  
she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family  
" elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room  
mr collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family  
" " already arisen ! " repeated mr bennet  
elizabeth was glad of it  
he was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could  
" " but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity  
but with me , it is not so  
" as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane  
he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them  
and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you  
at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book ! when i have a house of my own , i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library  
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ! " " i am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied sir william , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire  
your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done  
" chapter xviii  
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine

but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes  
and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of lady catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough  
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself  
but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy  
" mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward  
chapter xvii  
they attacked him in various ways  
you have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer  
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together  
i hate such false friends  
are sufficiently known  
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort  
we do not suffer by accident  
chapter xix  
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of mr collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings  
" " i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me  
her keenest attention was awakened  
but you have chosen your fault well  
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy  
" she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " oh ! mr bennet , you are wanted immediately  
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself  
i should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing  
and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire  
if she does not object to it , why should we ? " " her not objecting , does not justify him  
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier  
" " really , mr collins , " cried elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me exceedingly  
and very lively hopes of mr bingley ' s heart were entertained  
you were not by , when i told mamma , and the others , all about it  
" " care of him ! yes , i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care  
" " indeed i could not  
vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled ! oh ! my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? " mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject  
" " it may do very well for the others , " replied mr bingley  
in spite of her deeply rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive  
i described , and enforced them earnestly  
" " true  
she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty  
and as she considered that jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before  
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley  
she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself  
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters  
we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all  
" and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family  
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary  
" " speak to lizzy about it yourself  
and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice  
the other is charlotte ' s marriage  
she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found  
" i do not get on at all  
he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before  
" " a great deal of good management , depend upon it  
her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire  
" i see your design , bingley , " said his friend  
" kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry  
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more  
the letter was to this effect : " my dear lizzy , " i wish you joy  
i know it cannot be long  
and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections  
" when lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty  
" " an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth  
" elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness  
but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible  
there ' s for you ! she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool  
when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? " " nay , " cried bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning  
mr darcy said very little , and mr hurst nothing at all  
that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits  
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party  
they shook hands with great cordiality  
she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with  
" but mr gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears  
she is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and i understand highly accomplished  
had lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned  
" he has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! i had not believed it possible  
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr darcy  
and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody  
" elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham  
but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin  
we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb  
if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all  
but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty  
it was rather small , but well built and convenient  
they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence  
i know how much you dislike him  
and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible  
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart  
" very well  
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight  
well ! i am so happy  
but she is nothing to me now  
" i have no reason , i assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception  
your ' s , &c  
" i am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she  
and pride has often been his best friend  
our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered  
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister  
but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother ' s permission for this address  
her mother ' s ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth ' s mind  
charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness

and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars  
you must learn some of my philosophy  
as it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery  
miss bingley i am sure cannot  
in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves  
let wickham be your man  
to the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long  
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her  
and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much  
indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them  
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word  
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton  
" " you are then resolved to have him ? " " i have said no such thing  
" she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her  
his principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham  
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed  
but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere  
she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done  
" " i dare say she will  
the next was in these words  
the visit was returned in due form  
<num> 
lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her

" thursday was to be the wedding day , and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit  
but she was proud of him  
what did colonel forster say ? had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ? they must have seen them together for ever  
others of the party were now applied to  
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention  
and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be  
well , colonel fitzwilliam , what do i play next ? my fingers wait your orders  
mrs gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her  
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good naturedly engaged mr collins ' s conversation to herself  
the eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty seven , was elizabeth ' s intimate friend  
" " i do not think we were speaking at all  
i knew nothing at all of lady catherine ' s connections  
that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance  
" elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning  
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend  
and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled  
he came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed  
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance  
i shall now know how to act  
that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself  
" elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book  
and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible  
make haste , my love  
she looked at jane , to see how she bore it  
for as to mr darcy ' s using him ill , it is perfectly false  
we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them  
" i will go to meryton , " said she , " as soon as i am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister philips  
intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done  
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do  
a respectable looking , elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her  
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being  
but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good  
if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your ' s , i can only say that i am sorry  
" but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state  
the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres  
hopeless of seeing him before  
" elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply  
i speak feelingly  
but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her  
it is a pity they are not handsome ! not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend  
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter

it convinced her , that accident only could discover to mr bingley her sister ' s being in town  
and if i was her , i would not have put up with it  
in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy  
and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments  
at present i will say nothing about it  
" " well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him  
and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted  
you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her  
she had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means  
he wrote last week to hurry my return  
" elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight  
their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge  
and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , " what is the matter mamma ? what do you keep winking at me for ? what am i to do ? " " nothing child , nothing  
and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten  
" i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her  
every girl in , or near meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months  
" with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew  
to be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love  
on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks  
" " and what is your success ? " she shook her head  
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat  
you may ask questions , which i shall not choose to answer  
" her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained  
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor  
wretched , wretched , mistake ! " darcy made no answer  
lydia has no brothers to step forward  
many stared  
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it  
at first there seemed danger of lydia ' s engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker  
" she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word  
and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it  
and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again  
the officer was the very mr denny , concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed  
and all for the sake of mr collins too ! why should he have it more than anybody else ? " " i leave it to yourself to determine , " said mr bennet  
" the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share  
" charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time  
and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy  
and it was but the other day , that i recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her  
" miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour  
imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland  
mr hurst looked at her with astonishment  
elizabeth was not comfortable  
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her  
" " so much the better  
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened  
i am so grieved for him  
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them  
there can be no occasion for your going so soon  
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her  
i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood  
but she could not approve him  
" " certainly , sir  
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind ! no , no i feel he may defy us there  
re considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home  
let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers  
chapter vi  
and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business  
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr darcy  
it was not known that wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living  
but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future  
now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ? when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? " " these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature  
chapter xiv  
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired  
nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family  
but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue  
<num> 
mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day  
it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge  
she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare  
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed  
they could talk of nothing but officers  
it pains me to offend you  
and i wish with all my heart it may prove so  
her father had been an attorney in meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds  
" haye park might do , " said she , " if the gouldings would quit it , or the great house at stoke , if the drawing room were larger  
she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingley ' s regard  
she longed to see mrs philips , the lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " mrs wickham , " by each of them  
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours  
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s justifying her coming so far alone  
and then was enraged against herself for being so silly ! " a man who has once been refused ! how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings ! " she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself  
but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art  
" " i hope not so  
" his being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she  
" elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more  
it was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours  
" " yes  
and to him she had hardly courage to speak  
and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home  
what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go  
and then rising up , said to elizabeth , " miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn  
and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille , while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh ' s foot stool , that she said , 'mr collins , you must marry  
in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way  
lydia was exceedingly fond of him  
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once  
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life  
they were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain  
he is a most interesting young man  
recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " sir william ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of  
she could think of nothing else , and yet whether bingley ' s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends' interference  
but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody  
it was first broken by mrs annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others  
and i think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s  
but there were other causes of repugnance  
" jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall  
" elizabeth did not know what to make of it  
" " yes , madam , " said mrs bennet , delighted to speak to a lady catherine  
his father , miss bennet , the late mr darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had  
" i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! " cried jane  
" " no governess ! how was that possible ? five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! i never heard of such a thing  
" i dare say you will find him very agreeable  
" his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to netherfield  
your mother insists upon your accepting it  
mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ' s active superintendance , and when immediately before my father ' s death , mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself  
mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets  
" " but you will know it , when i have told you what happened the very next day  
" " mr darcy is all politeness , " said elizabeth , smiling  
" what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment  
adieu to disappointment and spleen  
i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother  
i wonder what he can be doing there  
promise me , therefore , to come to hunsford  
as the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park  
and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend  
neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach  
" oh ! lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! if i could but see you as happy ! if there were but such another man for you ! " " if you were to give me forty such men , i never could be so happy as you  
" i am sorry to hear that  
and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs collins ' s joints of meat were too large for her family  
when tea was over , mr hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain  
" i have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak  
and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then  
it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush  
" mrs bennet and her daughters then departed , and elizabeth returned instantly to jane , leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy  
and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous hearted , boy in the world  
she is not such a simpleton  
he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it  
because we shall see the less of him  
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was  
" let me first see how he behaves , " said she  
wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison  
you have liked many a stupider person  
and the girls smiled on each other  
elizabeth , on her side , had much to do  
in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger  
it was as follows : " my dear sir , " i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire  
the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself  
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield  
and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield  
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just  
causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me  
and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary  
the foundation ' s principal office is located at <num> melan dr  
but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal  
" mr darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter  
but you know married women have never much time for writing  
all was joy and kindness  
nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair  
" " as i did the other day , " said elizabeth , with a conscious smile  
gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green , something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w  
she had always felt that charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage  
if i can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too  
this was agreed to , and mrs philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards  
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him  
" " did not you ? i did for you  
neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane  
it was more than civil  
" mr gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday  
do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will  
" i hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother in law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue  
he was resolutely silent however  
if it must be so , it must  
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her  
if you mention my name at the bell , you will be attended to  
you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people  
" " and do you impute it to either of those ? " " yes  
" yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed  
" mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply  
but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me  
" elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend  
or allow her to hear it from any one but myself  
by the author of " sense and sensibility  
let me do it without farther loss of time  
on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate  
i hope he will overlook it  
if he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go  
but it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly  
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching  
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise  
" " oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! " " perhaps it would have been better  
" " but does lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand ? " " oh , yes ! that , that is the worst of all  
in three volumes  
" but , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here  
they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight  
they are not married , nor can i find there was any intention of being so  
" her aunt assured her that she was  
he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided  
to this speech bingley made no answer  
you will have a charming mother in law , indeed , and of course she will be always at pemberley with you  
" elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs  
there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard  
but he eluded the skill of them all  
elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph  
the evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of jane and elizabeth  
if i had ever learnt , i should have been a great proficient  
" i should like to know how he behaves among strangers  
" the gentlemen came  
" no , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain  
she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down  
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme  
he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address  
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents  
elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification  
" " remember , eliza , that he does not know jane ' s disposition as you do  
you dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind  
he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump  
" " yes , very indifferent indeed , " said elizabeth , laughingly  
a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age  
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me  
elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude  
she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse  
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life  
" nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance  
" elizabeth ' s misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion  
and poor mr darcy ! dear lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered  
on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them  
" chapter xxi  
" elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had  
and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing  
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal  
" " perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often  
it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast  
" charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth  
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton ! i owe all that i know of it , to another , not to you  
there is nothing marked in its lines  
" " he is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man  
you see how continually we are engaged there  
poor dear child ! and now here ' s mr bennet gone away , and i know he will fight wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? the collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave  
but before they heard again from mr gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from mr collins  
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family  
" on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " did not you think , mr darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ? " " with great energy  
lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter  
kitty is slight and delicate , and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on  
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united states  
she will follow wherever lydia leads  
the housekeeper came  
her face is too thin  
" " it ought to be so  
" elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing  
if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable  
he owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable  
but i was over ruled , as i always am  
but that is not the case here  
" mrs reynolds ' s respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master  
though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly  
their table was superlatively stupid  
after a short pause , her companion added , " you are too generous to trifle with me  
as a child i was taught what was right , but i was not taught to correct my temper  
but if i go on , i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem  
but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone  
on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent  
and while sir william accompanied him , charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help  
" " was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane , while she was ill at netherfield ? " " dearest jane ! who could have done less for her ? but make a virtue of it by all means  
and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better  
'lady catherine ,' said she , 'you have given me a treasure  
" then turning to mr bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon  
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room  
i think not  
he has been accused of many faults at different times  
after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display  
you will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him  
the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you  
for mrs bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , " good lord ! sir william , how can you tell such a story ? do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy ? " nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment  
but sir william ' s good breeding carried him through it all  
and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged  
after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses  
the strangeness of mr collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted  
she enquired after his sister , but could do no more  
" " is that his design in settling here ? " " design ! nonsense , how can you talk so ! but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes  
i remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well wisher and friend , william collins  
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine ' s visit  
while in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ! do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ? are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? " " yes , and i had heard it before  
" my dearest lizzy will , i am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley ' s regard for me  
i do not think it is very pretty  
when coffee was over , colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him  
" his estate there is a noble one  
all loveliness and goodness as she is ! her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating  
she practises very constantly  
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance  
and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that mr wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house  
it originated in mrs gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth ' s arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s  
and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn  
follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do divert me , i own , and i laugh at them whenever i can  
nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant  
what congratulations will then flow in ! i appeal to mr darcy : but let me not interrupt you , sir  
towards him i have been kinder than towards myself  
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all  
she had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years  
but mr collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with mr bennet , and prepared for backgammon  
i will have no reserves from you  
it now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors  
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did  
where else can they be so well concealed ? " " and lydia used to want to go to london , " added kitty  
and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations  
" " but why all this secrecy ? why any fear of detection ? why must their marriage be private ? oh ! no , no , this is not likely  
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth  
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast  
and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing  
she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times  
i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point  
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane  
" " perfectly so i thank you  
" " in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either  
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one  
" persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself  
through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance  
" " aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and mrs long does not come back till the day before  
i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted  
" what , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? poor little lizzy ! but do not be cast down  
and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcy ' s looks and behaviour  
but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self importance , and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeth ' s mind  
as that was the case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public  
he repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence  
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him  
" " that is not an unnatural surmise , " said fitzwilliam , " but it is lessening the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly  
[ illustration : a vicarage house  
" but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine  
" could i expect it to be otherwise ! " said she  
she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave  
" " miss bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that i am not to be trifled with  
and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate  
i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy  
" " i am grieved , indeed , " cried darcy  
oh ! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! " wickham , lydia , were all forgotten  
and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them  
that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex  
she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so  
" he is now gone into the army , " she added , " but i am afraid he has turned out very wild  
some people call him proud  
her ladyship ' s carriage is regularly ordered for us  
" do you certainly leave kent on saturday ? " said she  
" " but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? " " it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister ' s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt  
and then , what do you think we did ? we dressed up chamberlayne in woman ' s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun ! not a soul knew of it , but col  
donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks , online payments and credit card donations  
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield  
mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character  
this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving  
elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea  
and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard  
and then we were so merry all the way home ! we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! " to this , mary very gravely replied , " far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures  
elizabeth longed to explore its windings  
" on the evening before my going to london , " said he " i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago  
and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not decidedly better  
he has children of his own , and may have more  
but mr collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit  
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister  
but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps  
but his anger , i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ' s sentiments  
i never was  
the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock  
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants  
though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy  
" your great men often are  
as the day of his arrival drew near , " i begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said jane to her sister  
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain  
but when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham ' s resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate  
" and then , " said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself  
they have some of the finest woods in the country  
but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing  
this letter is from mr collins  
and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life  
she comes to us to day  
and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn  
she did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile  
in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected conversation  
oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenelworth , birmingham , &c  
" " yes , sir  
the pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men  
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security  
chapter xvii  
their other engagements were few  
that tall , proud man  
" " you have a very small park here , " returned lady catherine after a short silence  
" consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility  
but mr darcy can please where he chuses  
adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it  
a report which highly incensed mrs bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood  
" the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written  
" mr collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter  
she was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged  
she is all affability and condescension , and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over  
" i want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about mr wickham  
" " i did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present  
not equal to lydia ' s for him  
" " no i cannot talk of books in a ball room  
risk any thing rather than her displeasure  
though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice  
and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense  
chapter i  
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity  
i do not wish to avoid the walk  
by reason , by reflection , by every thing  
having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast  
but of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house  
that is all settled  
" but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , " replied her uncle  
she was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady lucas has been very kind  
" their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them  
elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him  
" " that is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily  
for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them  
when alone with elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject  
did you see it ? " bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations  
an hour , however , saw the whole completed  
elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion  
" he acknowledged the truth of it all  
console lady catherine as well as you can  
whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief  
and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her  
" let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size  
but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to  
only in different lines  
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ? he danced only four dances ! i am sorry to pain you but so it was  
this was exactly as it should be  
and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err  
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man  
there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time  
that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer  
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained  
" " you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said mr darcy , looking at the eldest miss bennet  
" " what is his name ? " " bingley  
he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much  
the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground  
you must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what i say  
" i have seen them both  
on tuesday , his wife received a letter from him  
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again  
and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself  
but your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family  
" did it , " said he , " did it soon make you think better of me ? did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? " she explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed  
but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere  
" but i can assure you , " she added , " that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy  
his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit  
my feelings will not be repressed  
" mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while mrs bennet was stirring the fire  
had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite  
i came to you without a doubt of my reception  
" lydia declared herself satisfied  
there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again  
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony  
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingley ' s name had been last mentioned between them  
copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change  
she looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend  
" oh ! my dear mr bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball  
i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you  
they have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression  
" i am astonished , " said miss bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books  
at such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable  
" " your humility , mr bingley , " said elizabeth , " must disarm reproof  
that such a consequence as this should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts  
but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour  
as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again  
till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance  
their reception at home was most kind  
for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men  
mrs gardiner ' s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone  
at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband  
her hopes were answered  
and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn  
by nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at st  
" he is certainly a good brother , " said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows  
in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on  
their fortune on both sides is splendid  
what relates to yourself , is as follows  
perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease  
" " my dear lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now  
mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves  
" but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte ' s wishes , to be the case  
at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , " mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain  
" " it is from miss bingley , " said jane , and then read it aloud  
and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send  
mrs gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head  
for mrs bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection  
mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible  
" " and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice  
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly  
" now i am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself  
i was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him  
but she was satisfied with none  
when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time  
she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when  
mr darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours  
by supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy  
" " much more rational , my dear caroline , i dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball  
" and of this place , " thought she , " i might have been mistress ! with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted ! instead of viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt  
charlotte tried to console her  
only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage  
<num> 
but i am at his disposal  
and the kind of half expectation which mrs gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing  
" " and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry ? did he know of their intending to go off ? had colonel forster seen denny himself ? " " yes  
" the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished  
yes , she will do for him very well  
mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday  
i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park  
and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine  
i shall go distracted  
for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars  
it was all over before i arrived  
and all that i can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself  
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind  

they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennet ' s civilities  
though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration  
respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever  
but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement  
mr collins must excuse me  
the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place  
he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family  
when mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte  
i will read it to you " when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel  
" now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy  
and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn , they would be going there for ever  
when he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ' s not being killed in a duel  
they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister  
and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more  
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all  
the gentlemen did approach  
why jane you never dropt a word of this  
" her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation  
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one  
has thrown herself into the power of of mr wickham  
such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed  
" this letter gave elizabeth some pain  
" your friend performs delightfully  
" " certainly not  
for else they will be destitute enough  
you are safe from me  
i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude  
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling  
" " i beg your pardon , " replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer  
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered  
she was teazed by mr collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others  
he is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably  
i am sure you will be very comfortable there  
" " you know nothing of the matter  
mr darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them  
if you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation  
kitty was too much afraid of him to talk  
and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe  
can i speak plainer ? do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart  
this was very amiable , but charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of  
chapter xvi  
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her  
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth  
that of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest  
and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase  
but it is so strange ! " " yes that is what makes it amusing  
upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself  
you mentioned two instances  
mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention  
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley  
and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay  
they will never be distressed for money  
" " that is all settled  
chapter xiii  
and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again  
but mrs bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday , which would exactly finish jane ' s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before  
i must speak to hill , this moment  
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your ' s  
i believe him to be lady catherine ' s nephew  
when she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner ' s in town , so much in love with her , that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away  
family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this  
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home  
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself  
" " if i were as rich as mr darcy , " cried a young lucas who came with his sisters , " i should not care how proud i was  
mr what ' s his name  
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light  
the subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity  
mrs bennet was quite disconcerted  
" " i mention it , because it is the living which i ought to have had  
he was her dear wickham on every occasion  
do we ? " darcy had walked away to another part of the room  
every thing being settled between them , mr darcy ' s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home  
i have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude  
her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous  
to be sure london was rather thin , but however the little theatre was open  
the day passed much as the day before had done  
she would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home  
they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , i do not know how long  
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste  
with them he is remarkably agreeable  
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn  
it is evident that you belong to the first circles  
for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived  
and fearful of its being mr darcy , she was directly retreating  
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves  
and mrs bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived  
mr darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found  
i am quite well  
it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane ' s attractions  
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together  
and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite  
they now walked on in silence  
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way  
" safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune  
" that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance  
" she is a great deal too ill to be moved  
" chapter xiii  
and she told me that it was certain true  
" chapter xiii  
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess  
the express was sent off directly  
mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday  
the park was very large , and contained great variety of ground  
the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd  
and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil  
" " then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce mr bingley to her  
but no such recollection befriended her  
there was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies  
" " i assure you , madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advice  
they were to be off as soon as possible  
if you have not been mistaken here , i must have been in an error  
" " i do not cough for my own amusement , " replied kitty fretfully  
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do  
" do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? i cannot quite agree with you there  
no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after  
but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour  
this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father ' s estate  
" " i cannot pretend to be sorry , " said wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts  
and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther  
first , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion  
elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes  
and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year  
" " perhaps , " said darcy , " i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers  
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane  
but now suppose as much as you chuse  
" this fine account of him , " whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend  
and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh  
" " well , and what news does it bring ? good or bad ? " " what is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from his pocket  
pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town , where the family did not visit  
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , " i did not know before that you ever walked this way  
to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed  
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case  
smiles decked the face of mrs bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door  
" " i had much rather go in the coach  
but this is the true one  
but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me  
" " pride , " observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing i believe  
" louisa , you will not mind my waking mr hurst  
" " and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma'am ? " " yes , very handsome  
" * * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday  
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not  
but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent  
they met several times , for there was much to be discussed  
are you going much farther ? " " no , i should have turned in a moment  
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see mr jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by jane ' s introduction of him  
and if he is disposed to make them any amends , i shall not be the person to discourage him  
to know that her daughter would be married was enough  
all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return  
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy  
] pride and prejudice : a novel  
but you do not know all  
but our visitor was very obstinate  
the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention  
but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer  
at length , however , the question was asked by her uncle  
i have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle  
after tea , mr bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument  
and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months  
colonel forster will , i dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head  
" elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment  
thank heaven ! i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him  
" then , after a short silence , he continued , " lizzy , i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind  
" " oh ! hang kitty ! what has she to do with it ? come be quick , be quick ! where is your sash my dear ? " but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters  
i know we dine with four and twenty families  
" " do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? " " sometimes  
were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him  
all elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away  
" " she did indeed , louisa  
in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels  
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds  
" " sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said mrs bennet , alarmed  
but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment  
and i never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! " " he is also handsome , " replied elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can  
i would go and see her , if i could have the carriage  
and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity  
her uncle and aunt were all amazement  
" " are you quite sure , ma'am ? is not there a little mistake ? " said jane  
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery  
but i am particularly attached to these young men  
her eldest daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged  
it would be dreadful ! she blushed at the very idea  
it came from netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer  
but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him  
anxiety on jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and mr darcy ' s explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost  
her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully  
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country  
and , before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out  
and , above all things , keep mr bennet from fighting  
but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded  
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter  
" and they are really to be married ! " cried elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves  
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do  
" lizzy , " said he , " i was going to look for you  
mrs collins , did i tell you of lady metcalfe ' s calling yesterday to thank me ? she finds miss pope a treasure  
so , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next  
she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall i call it ? susceptibility to her feelings  
but you must own she is very plain  
and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not  
" they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas  
she will be taken good care of  
" " my uncle is to send a servant for us  
but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome  
nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard  
the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter  
on the following monday , mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn  
i hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , i am absolutely certain  
but lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of captain carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to london  
but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful  
and they have another , who lives somewhere near cheapside  
lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations  
whatever he said , was said well  
but at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey  
not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the pemberley house , is a powerful motive  
with your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! affectation of candour is common enough  
mrs bennet ' s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " well , jane , who is it from ? what is it about ? what does he say ? well , jane , make haste and tell us  
she could not determine how her mother would take it  
i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy  
" " you are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment  
it is very unlucky  
these recollections will not do at all  
he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business  
but i think i may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer  
i cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago  
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? " " they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible  
she only smiles , i laugh  
and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness  
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower  
but , however , do not speak to mr darcy about it , if you had rather not  
no principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy  
i have told miss bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more  
pardon me  
i cannot acquit him of that duty  
" yet it is hard , " she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation ! i will leave him to himself  
at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward  
but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley  
his attachment to rosings , certainly increases  
mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it  
upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward  
but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much  
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there  
" " i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley ' s conduct to design , " said elizabeth  
" but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley ' s salutation  
the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off  
a lively imagination soon settled it all  
every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable  
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment  
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over  
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research  
it had better have happened to you , lizzy  
but good lord ! how unlucky ! there is not a bit of fish to be got to day  
we must forget it ourselves  
" " i have already told her so once , by your desire  
an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family  
" " why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks  
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time  
at any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life  
who should suffer but myself ? it has been my own doing , and i ought to feel it  
and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is  
and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them  
the lucases are very artful people indeed , sister  
and as she was no horse woman , walking was her only alternative  
when the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one  
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you  
" only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since i went away  
it adds even another motive  
general terms of use and redistributing project gutenberg tm electronic works <num> 
but they did pass away , and mr and mrs gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn  
mrs hurst thought the same , and added , " she has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker  
but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to mr darcy  
" when my eyes were opened to his real character  
" " how hard it is in some cases to be believed ! " " and how impossible in others ! " " but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge ? " " that is a question which i hardly know how to answer  
he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , " are you pleased with kent ? " a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk  
and when mr wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration  
the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits  
" however little mr darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer  
its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned  
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family  
" " probably not  
it is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side  
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy  
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry miss darcy  
" my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table  
" " you appear to me , mr darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection  
but of course she did not mention my name to you  
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer  
oh , brother , how kind you are ! i know you will contrive it all  
elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband  
his family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion  
he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her  
but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs bennet ' s curiosity  
" oh ! dear , yes  
yet he knew to the contrary himself  
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made  
at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas ' s accidental information , that bingley ' s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage  
she is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and i have no opinion of her  
from his garden , mr collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back  
mr wickham ' s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and mr collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could  
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married  
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room  
it is done , however , and it was done for the best  
very nonsensical to come at all ! why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? her hair so untidy , so blowsy ! " " yes , and her petticoat  
[ illustration : morning dress  
i hope at least he has not deceived us  
" oh ! yes i understand you perfectly  
" elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately  
" she is happy , then , " said her father , drily  
and he was obliged to walk about the room , while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences  
thank god ! i have not that pain  
" scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to rosings  
elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations  
" she is my youngest girl but one  
and with no one to speak to , of what i felt , no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had ! oh ! how i wanted you ! " " how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved  
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which i particularly begged him to do  
mr darcy may hug himself  
" there is nothing the matter with me  
and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it  
mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill  
but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin  
after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations  
she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary  
" i am sure there is not on his  
and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia  
in that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks  
" he should be particularly happy at any time , &c  
<num> 
are you much acquainted with mr darcy ? " " as much as i ever wish to be , " cried elizabeth warmly , " i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable  
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her  
" " ten thousand pounds ! heaven forbid ! how is half such a sum to be repaid ? " mr bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house  
i told you in the library , you know , that i should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word  
and then added , " may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mrs collins well  
how long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am i to wish you joy ? " " that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask  
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression  
nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion  
a lady ' s imagination is very rapid  
dearest lizzy , i hardly know what i would write , but i have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed  
i quite detest the man  
but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them  
it was in the times and the courier , i know  
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented  
" edw  
since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud  
at present i will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted " he was interrupted by a summons to dinner  
we neither of us perform to strangers  
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her  
chapter ix

her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much  
the dejection was almost universal  
she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour  
he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure i never want to see him again  
you sly thing ! well , i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley  
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours  
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable  
" what an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut  
my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made  
that he has neither integrity nor honour  
who should do it but her own uncle ? if he had not had a family of his own , i and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents  
and there was no necessity for such attention

had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best  
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon  
but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively  
pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned  
as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner  
after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful  
chapter xii  
and as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject  
and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage  
" but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands  
though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character  
in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self reproach  
and he found in mrs philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could  
his marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " wished they might be happy  
and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate  
and when i am in town it is pretty much the same  
he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn  
" jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail  
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when i write to them , and sign my name lydia wickham  
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life  
a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance  
" " well , my dear , " said mr bennet , when elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley , and under your orders  
how could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister ' s attachment  
" " yes , in conjunction with his friend  
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman  
had the late mr darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better  
and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves  
elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits  
and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her  
" " is my father in town ? " " yes , he went on tuesday as i wrote you word  
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse  
i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection  
and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended  
and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light  
and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty  
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission  
" " that is very true , " replied elizabeth , " and i could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine  
and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained  
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley ' s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s side , the acquaintance would now be renewed  
mrs bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married  
but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters  
but she is very young  
pride & prejudice  
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection  
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " " if we are ever able to learn what wickham ' s debts have been , " said elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own  
" " not at all , " he replied  
" " she is a great fool for going away , if she liked him  
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly  
his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had  
" you were mr bingley ' s first choice  
from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them  
and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , 'she a beauty ! i should as soon call her mother a wit  
" " very well  
seriously , i would have you be on your guard  
james ' s ? " " never , sir

in such an exigence my uncle ' s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world  
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured  
and in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away  
there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion  
but enough of this  
but my feelings are not only cordial towards him

he had never had the slightest suspicion  
bingley met them with hopes that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected  
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing  
but elizabeth , less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence  
" " you are all kindness , madam  
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house , i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , monday , november <num>th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se'night following , which i can do without any inconvenience , as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day  
" but , my dear elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is miss king ? i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary  
his character was to speak for itself  
" they have both , " said she , " been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea  
" " not as you represent it  
and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected  
" mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet  
society , i own , is necessary to me  
indeed , you must have seen it in the papers  
let us hope for better things  
" they will join me early to morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , mr bingley and his sisters  
kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon  
" mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner  
and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to mrs jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes  
he does not want abilities  
so imprudent a match on both sides ! but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood  
" he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle  
her figure was elegant , and she walked well  
" " but if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required  
many small donations ( $<num> to $<num>,<num> ) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs  
" " dining out , " said mrs bennet , " that is very unlucky  
in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him  
we have certainly done our best  
nor was darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery  
" mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies  
" for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds  
he readily agreed to it  
" the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret  
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters  
though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , " why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ? do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness  
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in kent ? " " i have heard from authority , which i thought as _ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron  
what say you , mary ? for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know , and read great books , and make extracts  
and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage  
on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer  
and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy  
the moral will be perfectly fair  
could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ? his temptation is not adequate to the risk  
his brow contracted , his air gloomy  
" you may well warn me against such an evil  
" oh , yes ! he was to come there with wickham , you know  
i did not expect it from you  
the particulars , i reserve till we meet  
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman  
and so would anne , if her health had allowed her to apply  
never mind miss lizzy ' s hair  
but the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name  
no  
and by a manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family  
we seem to have been designed for each other  
he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry  
and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men  
" " no , " replied jane , " i have not forgotten him  
" " i beg your pardon  
it was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing  
but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley ' s inattention  
his friend had given him the earliest information of it  
" " i never can be thankful , mr bennet , for any thing about the entail  
and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickham ' s attentions  
mr collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him  
i guessed as much  
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia , and , removed from the influence of lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid  
i do not know what to say to you  
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of miss lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of mrs philips' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation  
but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself  
as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following manner : " you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither  
after sitting a little while with jane , on miss bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour  
do let me ask my partner to introduce you  
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses  
it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind  
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache  
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her  
" i think there cannot be too little said on the subject  
it had not been very great  
but still he would be her husband  
egerton , military library , whitehall  
" " and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself ? does he know his real character ? " " i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did  
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance  
" he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town  
the sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her  
" " good god ! what is the matter ? " cried he , with more feeling than politeness  
and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable  
in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on  
how much you must have gone through ! " her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well  
" " mr darcy ! " repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement  
though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage  
mrs bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband ' s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income  
and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather

nothing could console and nothing appease her  
and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him  
you provide , in accordance with paragraph <num> 
they had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason  
" john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us  
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended  
every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away  
" " it will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them  
and he scarcely opened his lips  
no arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune  
" i do , indeed , " replied elizabeth , colouring  
and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks  
except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph <num> 
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say  
but , alas ! the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before  
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , mrs hurst and miss bingley  
i never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong  
pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary  
but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear  
mrs long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not  
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected  
and when mr bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was  
" she could think of nothing more to say  
and her invitation was accepted with alacrity  
we want none of them  
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship  
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic  
they all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses  
and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth ! what do i not owe you ! you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous  
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before  
his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing  
" jane looked at her doubtingly  
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view  
they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself  
but i believe we must abide by our original plan  
our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to you shall try it some day  
but the grounds are delightful  
but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he likes it  
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement  
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect  
" elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could  
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation  
" and taking her hand , he would have given it to mr darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to sir william , " indeed , sir , i have not the least intention of dancing  
the windows are full west

forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness

who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself  
every body says that he is ate up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise  
he arranges the business just as he pleases  
" " i should not be surprised , " said darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers  
how you must have hated me after that evening ? " " hate you ! i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction  
" " mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife  
it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women  
elizabeth jumped out  
the supposition did not pain her  
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty  
" " shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? " said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam  
it is from my cousin , mr collins , who , when i am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases  
" " i am sick of mr bingley , " cried his wife  
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement  
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far  
they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other  
" " how i long to see her again ! i never met with anybody who delighted me so much  
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it  
" not yet , " replied jane  
" i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town  
and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ? we cannot suppose he would help it , if he could  
and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it  
mrs bennet could hardly contain herself  
" and is this all ? " cried elizabeth  
and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me  
" elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat  
" the tumult of elizabeth ' s mind was allayed by this conversation  
" you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty

she approached , and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle piece  
elizabeth silently attended her  
but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " i saw you look at me to day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report  
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family  
well , much good may it do them ! and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead  
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday  
i am glad he dines here on tuesday  
he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it  
* * * * * in the evening , soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme

we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye  
" miss bennet still looked all amazement  
but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " mrs bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding  
" mrs collins , you must send a servant with them  
they have known her much longer than they have known me  
he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield  
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master  
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter ' s lips instead of your own  
and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , 'bingley , you had better stay till next week ,' you would probably do it , you would probably not go and , at another word , might stay a month  
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter  
when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room  
on the contrary , he was all attention to every body  
" " no , " said her father , " wickham ' s a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds  
as for jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than elizabeth ' s  
mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party  
his character was decided  
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield  
" he is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived  
" if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield , " said mrs bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , i shall have nothing to wish for  
other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose fordyce ' s sermons  
let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions  
he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else  
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before  
i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it  
but i have always observed , that they who are good natured when children , are good natured when they grow up  
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected  
as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information  
she saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown  
such very superior dancing is not often seen  
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcy that mr darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground  
during dinner , mr bennet scarcely spoke at all  
well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away  
what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received ! he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex  
a report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago  
miss bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley  
and oh ! how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner  
" " shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine , what is to befall her ? " " i am more likely to want time than courage , elizabeth  
her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men  
" " believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention  
i have no such injuries to resent  
and already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all  
only look at her  
when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness  
as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty  
i see the imprudence of it  
for though they could not all talk , they could all eat  
between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard  
it amazes me , i confess  
" it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane  
" gracechurch street , sept  
elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation  
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad  
he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her  
and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation  
when mr bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure  
elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , " you mean to frighten me , mr darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well  
and on these occasions , mrs gardiner , rendered suspicious by elizabeth ' s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both  
this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem  
" " i should imagine not  
i feel as if i had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve  
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness , and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due  
if the first , i should be completely in your way  
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man  
" elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " to treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourite of his father ! " she could have added , " a young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable " but she contented herself with " and one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as i think you said , in the closest manner ! " " we were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together  
and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there  
" if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " i shall know how to understand it  
advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to  
" " oh ! then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you  
and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction  
when breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters  
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me  
and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said , " if you are looking for my master , ma'am , he is walking towards the little copse  
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday  
" my dear , dear lizzy , i would i do congratulate you but are you certain ? forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? " " there can be no doubt of that  
who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? " as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to london , at the same time that mr bennet came from it  
lydia does not leave me because she is married  
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again  
he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things  
give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err  
she has known him only a fortnight  
but pride where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation  
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy  
i have by no means done  
( by the bye , mrs forster and me are such friends ! ) and so she asked the two harringtons to come , but harriet was ill , and so pen was forced to come by herself  
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art  
" elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready acquiescence  
and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley  
" " and you saw him frequently ? " " yes , almost every day  
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us  
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes  
lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball  
he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein  
what is your own opinion ? " " that it ought not to be attempted  
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn  
wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued  
" miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives  
mrs reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister  
after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight  
at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her  
in spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgment of her situation  
but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at  
they followed her into the dining parlour  
i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage  
bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter  
but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible  
jane was by no means better  
chapter xii  
" " that will not do for a compliment to darcy , caroline , " cried her brother " because he does not write with ease  
will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? " and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight  
lydia ' s being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment  
my excellent father died about five years ago  
he must write his own sermons  
don't think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side  
miss bennet ' s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority  
such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song  
but at length , by elizabeth ' s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation  
and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion  
came on into hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in barnet and hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through  
and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page  
gone to stay  
and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it  
after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : " you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it  
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you  
if i were not afraid of judging harshly , i should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this  
" " i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind  
but was too angry with lydia , to send any message to her  
with many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous  
one morning , about a week after bingley ' s engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage  
w  
and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men  
that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable  
" then addressing her daughter , " oh ! my dear , dear jane , i am so happy ! i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night  
elizabeth was delighted  
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley  
" " you need not distress yourself  
but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country  
" in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennet ' s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library  
i had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country  
so i will dictate , and you write for me  
and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter  
" what will be his surprise , " thought she , " when he knows who they are ! he takes them now for people of fashion  
" i cannot make him out  
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after  
" in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it  
bingley of course returned with him to dinner  
the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere  
" and so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house  
i always had a value for him  
" he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word  
he shall not be in love with me , if i can prevent it  
a small sum could not do all this  
the carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it , by dinner time  
and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first  
" " he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , " replied elizabeth with emphasis , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life  
when is your turn to come ? you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane  
for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match  
and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh  
" " it is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill  
you have no compassion on my poor nerves  
among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous  
his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited  
we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice  
" but this was all lost upon me  
" and she rose as she spoke  
too good for the waiter , is not it ? there is no danger of wickham ' s marrying mary king  
and mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment  
not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body  
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her  
they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose  
when they ascended the steps to the hall , maria ' s alarm was every moment increasing , and even sir william did not look perfectly calm  
" nay , " said elizabeth , " this is not fair  
his most particular friend , you see by jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her  
" " you observed it , mr darcy , i am sure , " said miss bingley  
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded  
the evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary  
but jane was very composedly talking to bingley  
for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path  
" " certainly , " replied elizabeth " there are such people , but i hope i am not one of them  
" " this is the consequence you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , " said elizabeth  
having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business  
" shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? " " i can answer your question , " said fitzwilliam , " without applying to him  
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation ( " the foundation " or pglaf ), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project gutenberg tm electronic works  
and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects  
" how can you be smiling so , lizzy ? " their affectionate mother shared all their grief  
" but what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? " " a thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy  
" but it is fortunate , " thought she , " that i have something to wish for  
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in  
perhaps that was the reason of his silence  
" " though it is difficult , " said jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit  
about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london  
london : printed for t  
your ' s , &c  
when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little  
and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room  
" lady catherine seemed pleased  
" " my dearest sister , now be be serious  
but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure  
" i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude  
and fourthly , that the match might be broken off  
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun  
mrs bennet ' s schemes for this day were ineffectual  
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses  
" " but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? " " you must decide for yourself , " said elizabeth , " and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by all means to refuse him  
" the wedding took place  
against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked  
" elizabeth made no answer  
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay  
" if we make haste , " said lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes  
chapter vii  
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense  
" " were it certain that lady catherine would think so , " said mr collins very gravely " but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you  
" how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter ! " he made no answer  
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? " elizabeth excused herself as well as she could  
" " you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir  
they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent  
one knows exactly what to think  
it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them  
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe  
and the good natured wishes for her well doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain  
she could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present  
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you  
and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour  
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern  
and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham  
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner  
till i can forget his father , i can never defy or expose him  
but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " oh ! mamma , do the people here abouts know i am married to day ? i was afraid they might not  
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology  
it was lady catherine de bourgh  
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet i think it is well expressed  
" " my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally i assure you  
" he only told me , what i have now told you  
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns  
in spite of having been at st  
pray , what is your age ? " " with three younger sisters grown up , " replied elizabeth smiling , " your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it  
he is so excessively handsome ! and his sisters are charming women  
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both  
and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet  
" " oh ! thoughtless , thoughtless lydia ! " cried elizabeth when she had finished it  
" they were all astonished  
gregory b  
" if i , " said mr collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air  
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one  
" that is rather singular  
but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side , i hope it will not be long before they are  
and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight  
and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned  
you are not going to be missish , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report  
" this is wholly unexpected  
i wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent  
the one missent must be first attended to  
but these , i suppose , are precisely what you are without  
" " oh ! my dear , " cried his wife , " i cannot bear to hear that mentioned  
and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army  
while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room  
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it  
" " you make me laugh , charlotte  
" elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply  
" while mary is adjusting her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to mr bingley  
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise  
and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved  
let me hear from you very soon  
mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all  
i cannot do justice to his kindness  
she has got over the most trying age  
perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me  
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw  
and you , yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him  
" about a month , " said elizabeth  
but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks  
but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed  
her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her  
the next morning , however , made an alteration  
her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious  
elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings  
she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance  
these parties were acceptable to all  
he was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty  
gardiner  
" the colour now rushed into elizabeth ' s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt  
and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age  
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one  
" " this is a wretched beginning indeed ! my sole dependence was on you  
* * * * * " good gracious ! " cried mrs bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley ! what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company  
for my part , mr bingley , i always keep servants that can do their own work  
she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther  
the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings  
mr bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county  
i shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance i require  
she certainly did not hate him  
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man , and talked very pleasantly  
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure  
" you used us abominably ill , " answered mrs hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out  
had elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort  
mr bennet treated the matter differently  
" very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that  
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever  
" wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look  
and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be  
and still different from either , was what mr bennet sent to mr collins , in reply to his last  
she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham  
to donate , please visit : <url> section <num> 
not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night  
and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance  
[ illustration : dove dale ] pride & prejudice  
any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year  
and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune  
" lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these  
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of  
he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise  
but think no more of the letter  
" from herself to jane from jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcy ' s explanation there , had appeared very insufficient  
with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility  
this cannot be ! engaged to mr darcy ! no , no , you shall not deceive me  
i told him , moreover , that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him  
on this subject , what can you have to say ? in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? " " you take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns , " said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour  
and during part of that time , mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it  
this mrs younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham  
would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress  
" " true  
i wish i could see her  
for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her  
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham ! your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions  
its business office is located at <num> north <num> west , salt lake city , ut <num>, ( <num> ) <num> <num> 
they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house  
he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia once  
" two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge  
" " i desire you will do no such thing  
i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure  
and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain  
with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family  
and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to  
if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once  
and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible  
the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg tm trademark , but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation  
but we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation  
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least  
and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance  
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion  
she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself  
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now  
" he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton  
my dear lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us  
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage  
and he and mr bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on  
but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising  
she is grown so brown and coarse ! louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again  
" this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities  
assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt  
and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard  
but really , ma'am , i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early  
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations  
you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it  
but will they make you happy ? " " have you any other objection , " said elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? " " none at all  
and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible  
" another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect  
i shall be back by dinner  
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts  
she now lost every expectation of pleasure  
and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence  
" " yes , vanity is a weakness indeed  
she dared not relate the other half of mr darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend  
only think of that my dear  
it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable  
" " i am talking of possibilities , charles  
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight  
this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled  
mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight  
nobody wants him to come  
and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life  
oh ! had i known what i ought , what i dared , to do ! but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much  
and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage  
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter  
and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way  
i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses  
and his behaviour , so strikingly altered , what could it mean ? that he should even speak to her was amazing ! but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting  
" she followed him thither  
mrs philips ' s vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance  
" i assure you , i feel it exceedingly , " said lady catherine  
mrs collins knew not what to make of him  
" i must ask whether you were surprised ? " said elizabeth  
while there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him  
to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point  
was it so ? " " yes  
but , however , that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determined  
" " no  
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for  
his regiment is there  
and till the morrow , their going was deferred  
" " ah ! sir , i do indeed  
james ' s , sir william was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word  
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information  
he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn  
on sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place  
mr wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return  
and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined  
" " my dear jane ! " exclaimed elizabeth , " you are too good  
at length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready  
and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good  
and , as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennet ' s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman ' s punctuality , both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs  
and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time  
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street  
jane ' s temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart  
i have faults enough , but they are not , i hope , of understanding  
and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum  
my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did  
and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her  
they are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line  
we have not met since the <num>th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield  
" my dearest child , " she cried , " i can think of nothing else ! ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! 'tis as good as a lord ! and a special licence  
with a book he was regardless of time  
we are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world  
in <num>, the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg tm and future generations  
&c  
" " how can you contrive to write so even ? " he was silent  
" " i do , i do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " i love him  
while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her  
as for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence  
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before  
" elizabeth could not but look surprised  
" elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment ' s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion  
" my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? " said her aunt  
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcy ' s farther notice  
what shall we do with him ? lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley ' s way  
in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her  
" " caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter  
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity  
elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased  
for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother ' s hands , lydia ' s expences had been very little within that sum  
" " it is no such thing  
mr darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together  
" i am astonished , my dear , " said mrs bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly  
she repented , though she hardly knew of what  
and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go  
yes , there was something in that  
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought , nor their offences against myself  
you thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say  
chapter iii  
he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday  
not these two or three years perhaps  
i must find mr gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed  
it is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions  
and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family  
" a gamester ! " she cried  
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world  
but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road  
to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men  
and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part  
jane listened with astonishment and concern  
" i have every reason in the world to think ill of you  
for who would object to such a partner ? " elizabeth looked archly , and turned away  
but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited  
a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification  
" i am sorry it went off  
" i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town  
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces  
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas  
i was ready to die of laughter  
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week  
of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself  
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power  
and then you must stay all night  
when her father continued , " you look conscious  
but it would not do  
conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain  
" but elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " no , no  
" but i am sure it will be too much for kitty  
" " you may as well call it impertinence at once  
never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings  
let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest  
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since i am well aware that it could not be complied with  
and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker  
and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball  
it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingley ' s being there  
email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the foundation ' s web site and official page at <url> for additional contact information : dr  
no wonder if they love her better  
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming  
had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt , to my own family ! had his character been known , this could not have happened  
" elizabeth could bear it no longer  
mr collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune  
my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i can't write  
and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others  
in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away  
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr philips ' s  
when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him  
of having another daughter married to mr collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure  
but does not jane correspond with the sister ? she will not be able to help calling  
mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to mrs collins  
but with a moment ' s recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often  
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself  
he took the hint , and soon began with , " this seems a very comfortable house  
" " so much the better  
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? if they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us  
if you do not charge anything for copies of this ebook , complying with the rules is very easy  
lady catherine rose also , and they turned back  
and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty  
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose  
this preservative she had now obtained  
and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning  
society has claims on us all  
and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared  
" she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse  
it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her  
" " mr collins moreover adds , " " i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia ' s sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known  
but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject  
" this is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good  
but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr darcy returned within the stated time  
in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister  
" " this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , " said he  
i know very well that nothing can be done  
wickham passed all his youth there , you know  
i  
but as i have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now  
" the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other  
it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it  
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself  
it mortifies me  
and she read it again  
he leaves out half his words , and blots the rest  
why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the case ? " " in the first place , " replied mr gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland  
we were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary  
" he then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister  
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant  
and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend  
you need not  
as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring  
" well , lizzy , " said mrs bennet one day , " what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane ' s ? for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody  
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear  
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable  
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy  
one has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it  
but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished  
" he is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear miss eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance  
" " oh ! no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both  
she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise  
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained  
to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr robinson  
his sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own  
" come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared  
your sister i also watched  
but his father ' s uncommon attachment to me , irritated him i believe very early in life  
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea  
" " you shall have it in few words  
" jane then took it from her pocket book , and gave it to elizabeth  
my mind was more agreeably engaged  
his plan did not vary on seeing them  
and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her  
" " some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me  
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas  
an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers  
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow  
sir william did not say much  
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly  
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london  
he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend  
" " may i ask to what these questions tend ? " " merely to the illustration of your character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity  
" do you prefer reading to cards ? " said he  
her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others  
she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards  
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair  
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so  
and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to  
and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were i distractedly in love with him , i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance  
the consequence of it is , that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have , and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever  
elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected  
" " upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except netherfield  
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement  
do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified  
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation  
i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer  
and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the door  
i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it  
and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice  
and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth  
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent  
and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh , i think it will be very tolerable  
he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend  
" when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence  
yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " you are mistaken , mr darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner  
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday , after my father went away  
yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease  
every disposition of the ground was good  
but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed  
" " oh ! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road  
" " undoubtedly , " replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation  
" i knew , " said he , " that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary  
and in this early example of what lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business  
she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit  
" " yes , and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise  
" " i am sure i know none so handsome  
his style was not penitent , but haughty  
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house  
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man  
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all  
about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire , to which he belonged  
she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address  
and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion  
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , i should not pay him half so much deference  
" my dear brother , " at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope will give you satisfaction  
but mrs bennet , was not so well pleased with it  
whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ' s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded  
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but mrs bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , " you are very kind , sir , i am sure  
and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts  
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men servants go with her  
" " yes , " replied wickham  
and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit  
" my dear mr bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that netherfield park is let at last ? " mr bennet replied that he had not  
he will immediately comprehend what i must feel , and i rely upon his goodness  
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications  
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage  
mary was the only daughter who remained at home  
a clear ten thousand per annum  
you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him  
she was received , however , very politely by them  
" i do not blame jane , " she continued , " for jane would have got mr bingley , if she could  
she liked him too little to care for his approbation  
his words seemed to imply it  
<num> 
they may wish many things besides his happiness  
chapter xvi  
he had to be sure done much  
but at last on mrs bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " oh ! that my dear mother had more command over herself  
mr collins ' s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete  
but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " jane , i congratulate you  
" it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane , " said she  
" " no , no , nonsense , lizzy  
an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton  
and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world  
" mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how  
" this was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! " said mrs bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own  
i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse  
" " at four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace making gentleman , " said mr bennet , as he folded up the letter  
i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it  
" for we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness  
your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with  
<num> 
" but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope every thing will be well  
mrs bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness  
" she looks sickly and cross  
for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company
