why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? " " why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear 	87.41943311621856
he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him 	76.97667850396469
" and when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " oh ! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop 	68.6050767969876

she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins 	71.30169651528144
i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older 	46.02018136196447
well , he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now 	64.5158046876551
mrs hurst thought the same , and added , " she has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker 	54.89165406827029
and with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ' s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn 	72.87299307462519
and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker 	48.95080924842932
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable 	55.624740288489996
but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them 	49.19151775648264
soon after their return , a letter was delivered to miss bennet 	51.114713925580794
when the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother ' s rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party 	96.90462888593721
" " perhaps i do 	8.831268904008892

her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies 	177.86696637973375
others of the party were now applied to 	95.27988077126692
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal 	151.57342966251687
and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance 	157.27993822624478

elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him 	98.28155344011832
how is such a man to be worked on ? how are they even to be discovered ? i have not the smallest hope 	86.29859196725795
he never saw him till the other morning at meryton 	48.445424701197304
" i have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech 	18.048152932901047
re considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home 	119.09039782923789
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr darcy 	16.095616911104305
" lydia declared herself satisfied 	97.81728731472715
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable 	66.16431616459002
" mr bingley followed his advice 	40.90651221042263
" " it is wonderful , " replied wickham , " for almost all his actions may be traced to pride 	28.70013908981756
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " in vain have i struggled 	111.31873715671995
and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh 	70.72064526954871
he did every thing best in the world 	21.447015905434778
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education 	44.00950125625844

egerton , military library , whitehall 	3.59021602657113
he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you 	79.77003579220025
" i found , " said he , " as the time drew near , that i had better not meet mr darcy 	14.279649461881387
" " your picture may be very exact , louisa , " said bingley 	38.1930691987317
i am very , very sorry 	12.798405272156465
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london 	26.309303736861636
family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this 	106.60746690400265
i will read it to you " when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel 	137.3557229737305
and their mother ' s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his 	37.58894438083255
chapter viii 	2.740340420276896
but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme 	58.68033800031347
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it 	296.5256697078599
" " her daughter , miss de bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates 	35.81842894949992
and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch 	74.03186194202281
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house , i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , monday , november <num>th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se'night following , which i can do without any inconvenience , as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day 	156.8171567182466
it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling 	426.624695621873
the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised 	52.110693491095006
she would be in nobody ' s way , you know , in that part of the house 	33.72620612150282
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply 	114.23949715921113
but she does not know , no one can know how much i suffer from what she says 	28.42511166552636
every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable 	136.76953963462122
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery 	82.76158850044214
she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject 	56.78264130065358
but in vain 	4.117364953955587
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter , and concluded with her brother ' s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country 	58.56233074597901
and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held 	155.59487159291592
" " i do not cough for my own amusement , " replied kitty fretfully 	21.419279930058924
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme 	65.55774100964337
she repented , though she hardly knew of what 	33.23732988890994
i often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice 	59.17152039769028
" before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer 	90.93116296668751
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family 	89.0087129951157
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother ' s schemes 	55.0624262892114
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth 	53.910522943366004
" yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed 	20.280758006632627
and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire 	31.177021944077758
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity 	134.52873356189318
this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married 	33.14874790722576
i cannot think so very ill of wickham 	9.229765618004068
it was my brother gardiner ' s drawing up too , and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it 	53.43776632648624
and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters 	62.08102896086444
elizabeth was delighted 	9.426799359399704
charles , when you build your house , i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley 	136.2633895796436
" " take care , lizzy 	14.377656349093266
chapter xv 	2.740340420276896
neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach 	234.7588130741599
" " no , " said her father , " wickham ' s a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds 	21.62944436483676
perhaps i am not doing her justice 	56.607567364334486
advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to 	75.35838623400086
and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil 	77.19571468989383
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture 	227.66242866938032
never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f 	73.34668429464595
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all 	81.8319447869413
they are in the same profession , you know 	26.604860964127656
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on 	49.588623878436
" " if ! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ? do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? " " i never heard that it was 	51.219692688107955
" " i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do 	32.01192208945381
and sometimes did venture a short sentence , when there was least danger of its being heard 	172.0693338021286
the agitations of former partiality entirely so 	97.89496875602332
mrs bennet could hardly contain herself 	14.407769305966152
but elizabeth , less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence 	191.40619446479175
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it 	56.8932849084352
but , alas ! the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before 	87.78325329407599
" you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking 	265.57707460534965
" " i am sure i know none so handsome 	13.611716754816507
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune 	183.93865129940204
there was no want of discourse 	54.85457415121812
that is my idea of good breeding 	25.874561045750784
" good heaven ! can it be really so ! yet now i must believe you , " cried jane 	55.35388134003542
but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase 	81.81928905010044
but consider how much it must increase his disappointment 	120.12556270045496
and when they next met , he looked at her only to criticise 	40.10379623547069
now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ? when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? " " these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature 	163.60266727447674
" " no , lizzy , that is what i do not choose 	21.395263470380158
and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike 	189.7316811372258
lydia ' s voice was heard in the vestibule 	66.27358840579899
but of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house 	109.25294483794104
at any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life 	51.38309086855939
elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable 	71.98204582683901
" " so much the better 	2.833187103805456
you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner 	334.4537374960119
never mind miss lizzy ' s hair 	44.45686127576251
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand 	68.98819783437945
not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night 	99.01851116047048
the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father 	53.432132058154835
" " was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane , while she was ill at netherfield ? " " dearest jane ! who could have done less for her ? but make a virtue of it by all means 	129.4086639408962
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but mrs bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , " you are very kind , sir , i am sure 	61.74606558743919
" i am sure there is not on his 	16.60825809959815
and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of kitty ' s and lydia ' s purchases , were seated in it 	58.412356338519395
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light 	185.64920741821882
and as she considered that jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before 	66.26971218915722
and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments 	48.88219365467899
and mrs hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother ' s conversation with miss bennet 	66.27720398772024
when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley 	64.87202741356856
at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction 	60.08603494798699
it soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family 	45.960880732277616
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research 	161.9403452180996
at that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion 	141.90793798180817
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing 	184.39347407298797
i am sorry to say it of them , but so it is 	25.18728107431961
one does not know what to think 	7.941164186818249
" " no , no 	3.3435977983775045
" i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia , " said she , " though i am not her particular friend 	47.32858329799443
mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed 	175.7026453254651
they are all for what they can get 	42.47410845432126
pray make my excuses to pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to night 	73.91357309083378
miss bingley saw all this likewise 	25.447932701776146
" but jane could think with certainty on only one point , that mr bingley , if he had _ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public 	94.5316321011435
and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon 	65.6289512545539
" " but , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , i am sure 	24.1540985590898
and she dwelt with energy on his many merits , as they proceeded together up the great staircase 	117.31368733116574
and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time 	14.583418243247046
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself 	102.46366458791195
" " we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes , " said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit 	30.553878734239806
and elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations' consent , there was still something to be wished for 	75.44610014474472
" " are you quite sure , ma'am ? is not there a little mistake ? " said jane 	28.32216124884693
you are to understand , miss bennet , that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose 	51.70886703579628
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced 	182.97030139487285
we are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world 	59.87314453924989
but her letters were always long expected , and always very short 	71.35243872901734
miss bingley i am sure cannot 	22.489878269425304
elizabeth immediately began playing again 	54.68107962672372
i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you 	18.864016166972878
but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment 	48.661204748652715
mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old 	74.84553074705974
" a long dispute followed this declaration 	65.91354237891171
and secondly , of my room 	11.503711995406402
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances : and to have mr collins instead ! her liveliness had been never worse timed 	372.1335551681795
her fellow travellers the next day , were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable 	111.64819939505249
<num>	4.24676143746824
" " you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate 	30.352656375581713
you know i always speak my mind , and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves 	91.62855193047582
such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them 	76.5154979496543
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind 	28.58301936370597
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world 	87.33137562876772
" " certainly , sir 	6.914382338284724
" but surely , " said she , " i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me 	56.01612037959685
but at last on mrs bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " oh ! that my dear mother had more command over herself 	78.21335687026178
it was not known that wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living 	101.0482521180637
my dear jane , mr collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow minded , silly man 	49.54390398990031
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennet ' s ill humour or ill health 	210.90632478044714
you must not disappoint your father 	16.10285676054338
he was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could 	55.22085702306247
and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day 	80.01758338218039
lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " but if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer 	61.86801455478656
" elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation 	22.099798008009078
i must confess myself surprised by your application 	167.28934319649196
i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection 	200.53672412966554
but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it 	68.5508086866881
if the first , i should be completely in your way 	53.275713369647406
pride & prejudice 	6.087449372208433
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday 	27.0494182219293
i hope at least he has not deceived us 	26.942527645815698
and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say , three very silly sisters 	157.43420922558738

unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only child ) i was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own 	168.72842500580546
and to be kept back on such a motive ! i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind 	74.72410953192929
good bye 	4.619399679576384
but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just 	139.30913815942537
but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister 	130.85708878620542
consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy 	69.63509414070562

" " his manners are very different from his cousin ' s 	18.6837596154038
and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself 	136.09727129281848

i know it to be impossible 	4.021596952703503
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see mr jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by jane ' s introduction of him 	98.06029942307259
but mr collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with mr bennet , and prepared for backgammon 	145.9975839207684
i am quite well 	7.376600265389369
of course , we hope that you will support the project gutenberg tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg tm name associated with the work 	87.1950759588252

colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon 	128.8146750751859

i knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them 	117.15284238369848
" " but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied darcy 	60.21798693882279
she had very little notice from any but him 	48.42600096579077
it was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her ' s 	31.206253220536585
" " pride , " observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing i believe 	48.13778052755949
" next time you call , " said she , " i hope we shall be more lucky 	71.55034540591541
his character was to speak for itself 	37.098431345195664
but mr collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit 	178.3350948393302
" " oh ! yes , " said elizabeth drily " mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him 	29.18670191939969
&c 	5.695003890444734
miss bennet ' s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural 	142.03304522196515
" if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside , " cried bingley , " it would not make them one jot less agreeable 	32.70602113102397
but she is nothing to me now 	14.667616478379136
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance 	142.98035645714063
" what is mr darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ? i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear 	82.90638119868733

the lucases are very artful people indeed , sister 	43.72208633718329
mr collins must excuse me 	22.040850606342445
the visit was returned in due form 	111.20856592699955
she was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when 	67.9763212744348
the advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely 	273.95201939602083
these are conditions , which , considering every thing , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you 	57.61536434061339
and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " go to your father , he wants you in the library 	38.37185960920252
but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley ' s inattention 	13.690684108418099
i cannot find out that i hate her at all , or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl 	35.41588535504106

the officer was the very mr denny , concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed 	115.87605241265099
her father had been an attorney in meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds 	24.643765733287076
dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship ' s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give 	149.47966839774796
and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem 	83.29899014105781
" he is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived 	19.70671643867736
he had never had the slightest suspicion 	30.397103992359693
wickham is safe 	136.57892118713536
nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again 	54.87500763210464
it is highly improper 	14.072425327181497
" he is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear miss eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance 	60.65067818298885
and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather 	57.534365041982625
mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless 	62.21608277914248
lydia ' s being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment 	119.92949607880972
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her 	29.072842670352838
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing 	36.945166668882905
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and i spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer 	127.06156051960059
gardiner 	5.044829902789781
" what could become of mr bingley and jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs 	167.7269620017032
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest , but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering 	138.11666302434193
mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper 	74.13126523843341
the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances 	73.39336094728381
" you are too hasty , sir , " she cried 	15.042919380828941
" " you must not blame my aunt 	15.00126067608514
for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars 	26.46078651512306
he cannot afford it 	38.10921094968709
" " is my father in town ? " " yes , he went on tuesday as i wrote you word 	45.8012189812522
" you are quite a visit in my debt , mr bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned 	39.21845418523464
and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be 	70.11220077972621
and so would anne , if her health had allowed her to apply 	186.33693815389142
my feelings in every respect forbid it 	19.540004113428715
mr collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr darcy ' s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way 	82.06320131155634
they are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain 	166.23332444690334
she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable 	312.1407311136981
and they have another , who lives somewhere near cheapside 	55.85151996585605
but i will make her know it 	17.735573275440895
but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " and pray , what is the usual price of an earl ' s younger son ? unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds 	139.79003274239076
at length , however , the question was asked by her uncle 	29.108345064899016
mr darcy looked up 	13.985632606412324
after tea , mr bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument 	54.46648253906155
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends 	158.09510732229623
his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it 	51.17633050570625
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink 	41.76817844501602
an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers 	109.61142594875287
but sir william ' s good breeding carried him through it all 	43.70058515026766
what made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? " " because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement 	79.27031486152107
" " it will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them 	53.64645588153814
as they drove to mr gardiner ' s door , jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival 	89.01562911186589
as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the collinses' reach 	161.3742052309342
" " she is a great fool for going away , if she liked him 	19.365916877946912
" does that young lady know mr darcy ? " elizabeth coloured , and said " a little 	62.27416244887969
and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty 	95.48823259982483
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia 	50.30440552956772
but you must own she is very plain 	71.76329979060176
i cannot blame myself for having done thus much 	129.35590984729768
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement 	53.2653297685797
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word 	18.700421252540632
but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt 	132.51097035561656
no one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection 	111.8948870992514
one has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it 	55.68883987902771
and elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane 	101.53266694749527
" yet it is hard , " she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation ! i will leave him to himself 	94.25750080587726
for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy , who sat opposite to them 	50.294779041285494
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon 	81.44902493691927
" " money ! my uncle ! " cried jane , " what do you mean , sir ? " " i mean , that no man in his senses , would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after i am gone 	97.93882949536149
chapter x 	2.740340420276896
your sister i also watched 	368.435381708584
" wickham only shook his head 	21.670779705139974
i have told miss bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more 	96.92899850404687
his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary 	37.06301244638417
and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy ' s , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible 	94.51542749812053
his countenance , voice , and manner , had established him at once in the possession of every virtue 	98.1350625814326
mrs bennet invited him to dine with them 	36.32354364320311
" she cried 	3.9653050304831092
" lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue 	47.01107100693317
kitty was too much afraid of him to talk 	30.47479576368124
" " have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ? but now it comes out 	59.384848325605425
of having another daughter married to mr collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure 	101.93729552723168
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one 	171.50023206506665
she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence 	254.25319289047238
i was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit 	193.16513193883839
and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day 	68.22301988579922
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation 	61.02693818778489
but lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of captain carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to london 	30.544300509966014
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together 	92.0803630490249
the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before 	95.33297197391478
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this 	18.532882404802834
" " you have only proved by this , " cried elizabeth , " that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition 	25.915156430230248
in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce 	128.4352596169415
but now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice 	55.24177660418597
this information , however , startled mrs bennet 	25.049458326690903
they have some of the finest woods in the country 	24.207513015882355
among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous 	94.0116262938288
i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood 	37.243842528265155
he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible 	71.49316672811936
and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter 	39.69461874827053
and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them 	50.5047873613538
he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her 	30.9911375461633
but for your sakes , we would do any thing 	28.00528274236003
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy ! that he should have been in love with her for so many months ! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection 	52.60711829419693
" what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr darcy ! there is nothing like dancing after all 	93.36663974891205
" " you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters 	39.3345420892607
mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates 	46.14870321651391
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both 	91.49541904389258
dearest lizzy , i hardly know what i would write , but i have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed 	53.695007843844365
mr darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours 	81.25352008833308
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed 	94.84007144418892
well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone 	110.0373157527967
" read it aloud , " said their father , " for i hardly know myself what it is about 	59.89437345497934
and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find 	62.76974019751134
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them 	70.44701101003545
and as she was no horse woman , walking was her only alternative 	67.14874548571508
" e 	4.33909710070551
" elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak 	115.52702812353424
she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence 	59.296467017229126
when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him 	90.75203007935318
your mother insists upon your accepting it 	66.50190169260046
for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone 	80.51984506294681
and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared 	163.8736065990023
" " my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally i assure you 	36.50872529766359
and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham 	73.51087794901326
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art 	15.588453161792234
newby chief executive and director gbnewby<mention>	29.2364096666598
" " you may as well call it impertinence at once 	35.46584914730796
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , " when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood 	152.15479591656504
and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard 	63.90484366816503
when the ladies returned to the drawing room , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted 	87.54456665088608
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it 	33.660066191830275
elizabeth felt jane ' s pleasure 	25.854106990093843
chapter vi 	2.740340420276896
our authority was too good 	52.862743976524264
and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground 	115.37278157733981
avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible , saying not much to elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others 	41.46177569735245
she enquired after his sister , but could do no more 	31.405408357068076
see <num> h 	31.606777614298707
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope , though you have but a short lease 	47.672465887480044
and what do you think she said besides ? 'ah ! mrs bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last 	57.96040730195566
and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be 	54.56057449090869
i should infinitely prefer a book 	33.6249806098155
at such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented 	34.99396258475402
the possibility of meeting mr darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred 	224.04762263743848
i am glad of one thing , that he comes alone 	27.00711798773658
you may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or distributing project gutenberg tm electronic works provided that you pay a royalty fee of <num>% of the gross profits you derive from the use of project gutenberg tm works calculated using the method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes 	111.0517601366308
and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter 	46.800595265624615
when the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to elizabeth , " do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel 	12.698828444522396
they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose 	53.321371943479264
and then when we came away it was such fun ! i thought we never should have got into the coach 	58.97704513647884
to all the objections i have already urged , i have still another to add 	250.31611687916424
as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents 	94.61239669605669
and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment 	51.130282011032605
it was really a very handsome thought 	33.9891257008709
" i told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy 	39.857642446804576
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends 	110.60942819358853
she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford 	62.38667611495156
" the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written 	136.4166837117996
mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears 	36.18480179589519
when mr collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten 	127.42886264184374
and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again 	193.13489310184744
and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate 	66.95708524355506
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection 	60.385749007129235
and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings 	89.832307477213
and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit 	65.58743628008531
on the contrary , he was all attention to every body 	15.99393818381209
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them 	24.464583622866694
" her father lifted up his eyes 	31.976063934801257
and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour 	78.42934515271996
in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on 	59.741831976382805
he placed himself by her 	58.123550194491116
mrs gardiner ' s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone 	62.07169677515874
a little time therefore 	33.39269260731827
" yes if darcy does not put it off again 	43.858107648951304
" if we make haste , " said lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes 	44.449545521825215
mrs gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her 	30.47464762245348
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet i think it is well expressed 	173.70095448875267
" " i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want 	46.29626837378745
all that his library afforded 	24.502774372834114
her hopes were answered 	61.6130449964578
" " and you saw him frequently ? " " yes , almost every day 	25.895483082217858
" " oh ! hang kitty ! what has she to do with it ? come be quick , be quick ! where is your sash my dear ? " but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters 	79.59469624620698
and i am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune 	47.549829250611566
compliments always take you by surprise , and me never 	233.65563618288823
chapter xii 	2.740340420276896
mrs bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married 	51.54977959077112
i am afraid you will be angry 	8.01563978750491
after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display 	167.63666273936255
as a child i was taught what was right , but i was not taught to correct my temper 	77.2594183583432
" " you observed it , mr darcy , i am sure , " said miss bingley 	9.216631225003422
chapter xv 	2.740340420276896
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states 	57.86197354795059
when they ascended the steps to the hall , maria ' s alarm was every moment increasing , and even sir william did not look perfectly calm 	58.591208289919734
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family 	40.70065822088555
on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them 	43.99187873239316
and thither also went mr wickham , undoubtedly by design 	201.63974959156118
i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day 	35.61488430351764
" " but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham 	31.835797090024244
" i knew , " said he , " that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary 	26.604587391145433
and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close 	320.5493406418413
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded 	177.57763372993
well , much good may it do them ! and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead 	45.666356022734
" there were some very strong objections against the lady , " were colonel fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london 	70.06922222286751
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish 	78.53364053381652
come , kitty , i want you up stairs 	37.385649414493116
" i should like to know how he behaves among strangers 	34.237756896906824
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse 	150.10009706733285
the former continued the subject , by saying , " but tell me all and every thing about it , which i have not already heard 	60.84133704519303
" to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia 	120.79215348975518
and when you have given your ball , " she added , " i shall insist on their giving one also 	90.27398248456434
" " do you suppose them to be in london ? " " yes 	13.433660568366266
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not 	45.252847263531336
and till the morrow , their going was deferred 	44.62630551807974
though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole 	111.18522598407279
but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself 	115.72301368097314
calling back the servant , therefore , she commissioned him , though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible , to fetch his master and mistress home , instantly 	219.17040287994524
but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended 	41.47911040791055
* * * * * " good gracious ! " cried mrs bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley ! what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company 	60.27292114081243
but i confess they would have no charms for me 	56.363625454785904
but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money 	99.15244511411858
lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention 	151.28389302681103
she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy , she moved again towards the gate 	91.03574668063827
she longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say 	15.36355185993622
" and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your _ make such an exhibition 	17.612127291464613
and he might imagine , from my father ' s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter 	85.10364134414901
but ashworth is too far off ! i could not bear to have her ten miles from me 	67.60889812471723
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure 	53.640485954363584
but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and mr darcy appeared 	51.20778333764806
and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man , asked her how she had liked him 	24.313493028074628
<num>	4.24676143746824
jane resolutely kept her place at the table 	67.7092136092528
it came from netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer 	22.994517576178822
" it must not be thought of 	21.553444668195837
i now give it to you , if you are resolved on having him 	59.899633462729675
but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library , ) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels 	107.80967512702485
it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome 	33.94788895328253
" " mr darcy is not to be laughed at ! " cried elizabeth 	12.571984347600198
and her invitation was accepted with alacrity 	50.84743351615332
but to say the truth , i was too cross to write 	79.695507556004
he now wished it more than ever 	44.02023144621816
it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture 	88.67850030287451
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony 	138.9847086286472
i have a high respect for your nerves 	68.77565871594234
but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me 	70.42947116479618
and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment 	88.04224490253729
mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley ' s visit in gracechurch street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance 	90.25743353727154
" " miss bingley , " said he , " has given me credit for more than can be 	24.180566618638903
and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject 	64.17234609038847
you must contrive to send somebody 	36.236038531748406
and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn , they would be going there for ever 	85.61253429401245
and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense 	187.29853331607939
" there is something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming 	21.47558532978978
and from all bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own 	94.49749386800836
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter 	169.06227186470866
a thousand things may arise in six months ! " the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt 	390.2713046827853
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill 	170.67967217360686
" she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham 	64.8326989057701
he could even listen to sir william lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st 	86.06351512329991
jane had not been gone long before it rained hard 	160.2618875645386
they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria 	107.5413996776355
" on the evening before my going to london , " said he " i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago 	35.20822590325217
nobody wants him to come 	39.41702694437343
they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other 	38.814206579332065
but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting 	23.19059443801398
are you much acquainted with mr darcy ? " " as much as i ever wish to be , " cried elizabeth warmly , " i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable 	63.35869941302892
i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way 	60.1004388410056
but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour 	19.815711002608694
he enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done 	84.11048278345022
james ' s , sir william was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word 	62.98916535929768
for as to mr darcy ' s using him ill , it is perfectly false 	87.81075767842482
perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease 	67.04712529283809
" louisa , you will not mind my waking mr hurst 	167.7588029499506
the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport 	113.44025667139255
except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph <num>	24.85897763218718
miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house , and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane 	87.33592870149269
" their party in the dining room was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them 	302.91356133145433
the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this 	81.08971006608083
lady catherine might see him in her way through town 	45.15451790486454
" oh ! she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld ! but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and i dare say , very agreeable 	66.39706701968628
and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous hearted , boy in the world 	39.55234864473105
but mr darcy can please where he chuses 	75.08275855395907
" mrs bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library 	23.21782946821927
and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table 	24.034071754906876
mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham ' s desertion , and complimented her on bearing it so well 	43.063977768639745
" i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ' s intimates in the regiment , whether wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself 	58.23255847779435
" " you appear to me , mr darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection 	53.96774347646452
though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly 	122.97639590438709
i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when mr denny comes back from town 	75.35089335294364
she studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different 	87.72029027616816
" " i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied 	35.142139107142
and if i was her , i would not have put up with it 	26.054014513761224
" i want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about mr wickham 	55.11133437985767
and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection 	115.85864394317909
maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder 	47.20226420167776
one ought not to repine 	18.19786595544566
elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him 	56.560287918311715
" " to oblige you , i would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this 	56.89275445055618
at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself 	68.74175179014388
that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me 	36.11258717348166
and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations 	22.01400385524305
" " certainly not 	3.249333275963587
but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again 	175.72275265332118
" " she had better have stayed at home , " cried elizabeth 	15.801113589714989
but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure 	26.073217119170092
" it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first 	49.41312681725177
for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible 	40.67759634406425
it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary 	94.96691951407327
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home 	75.99715122450594
" how near it may be to mine , i cannot pretend to say 	45.97688551173659
when mr bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure 	46.235007721132405
for on first hearing it , mrs bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable 	199.61608763229896
advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts 	43.08717488214982
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy 	78.38045187885739
elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr wickham and herself 	15.34138574100889
and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required 	47.2298093776138
" how can you be smiling so , lizzy ? " their affectionate mother shared all their grief 	66.77385165339706
she could not bear such suspense 	108.36843033454471
" but so we all do 	14.814029861134163
lydia , my love , ring the bell 	32.364200923222036
she felt anew the justice of mr darcy ' s objections 	26.915812459247775

perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones 	1344.0714162543436
and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent 	128.49526350278362
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety 	105.83826852228671
" this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away 	100.49871147969135
" " he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , " replied elizabeth with emphasis , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life 	54.539791274680354
" she is a great deal too ill to be moved 	51.89355208423514
but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible 	81.30057152522707

their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves 	61.519706834342436
" this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham ' s being among them 	35.184404327056804
" by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter 	58.18531963736049
" he listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long 	92.91065965303567
miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much 	56.42090881744006
she read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again 	34.29590451927466

" jane then took it from her pocket book , and gave it to elizabeth 	60.54634509704549
this son was to join in cutting off the entail , as soon as he should be of age , and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for 	104.01892509914126
" i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle 	103.1229838337337
and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it 	30.902133749586017
elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes 	139.80264645604788
and you cannot imagine how well he looked ! when denny , and wickham , and pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least 	65.40616195570145

and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained 	162.88237545946717
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began 	10.329961272138224
all elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away 	61.40000153056258
mr hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad 	96.23154311826026
while sir william was with them , mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country 	70.0429680387904
we seem to have been designed for each other 	24.25440367559557

" " miss elizabeth bennet ! " repeated miss bingley 	13.375495277607683
she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings , and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening 	85.49095588901307

" miss bennet paused a little and then replied , " surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully 	38.744350711314226
it was agreed to 	12.482080163787106
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend 	28.19878971825992

and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room 	25.920254385207148
" mrs hill began instantly to express her joy 	68.04618057298391
and i know i appeared distressed 	56.47561620184557
and sleeping one night on the road , reached longbourn by dinner time the next day 	72.97095439202045
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in 	80.74331615773453
" " but does lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand ? " " oh , yes ! that , that is the worst of all 	71.97265445663596
for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? " " oh ! " cried elizabeth , " i am excessively diverted 	44.42007490028226
he is a gentleman 	9.580787447621962

it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations 	48.871685729945646
as it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery 	117.22979968968103
we were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary 	65.51221742200649
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it 	43.16634552033163
to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment 	108.11436699516216
in a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other 	27.91514869169991
she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty 	112.34580262602698
" " except , " thought elizabeth , " when she goes to ramsgate 	28.941255991478386
but i always speak what i think 	28.963450168369363
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united states 	120.80396397974425
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort 	110.24393536001459
" " sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said mrs bennet , alarmed 	21.928979632811494
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body 	31.40273022140961
jane was distressed 	10.255289782066445
intending to trace their route 	33.16671467755535
w 	5.306902370656392
she could think only of her letter 	13.821814934742358
her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully 	122.58617132917364
i certainly have had my share of beauty , but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now 	37.29098333587685
" " their conduct has been such , " replied elizabeth , " as neither you , nor i , nor any body , can ever forget 	131.16702692991103
who instantly taking the alarm , set off from b 	122.16582346779002
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured 	159.3246522927725
and even jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them 	125.91552553199118
who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself 	105.32762708111989
and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go 	42.79957294912955
" darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject 	16.555288557693782
she looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend 	165.8434396171245
she is quite a little creature 	31.823911423347052
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride 	26.920734593412025
and within five miles of lambton , elizabeth found from her aunt , that pemberley was situated 	63.166879317141515
it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street 	94.77308911735203
" " this is a wretched beginning indeed ! my sole dependence was on you 	72.91243912685647
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over 	118.38665077383442
let me mend it for you 	42.2816001708202
and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing 	134.65106746145267
" " his pride , " said miss lucas , " does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it 	36.40884817094663
we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon 	38.85676956690099
she was aware that no one liked him but jane 	57.28372518458193
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself 	137.33583245901372
" and with a bow to mr darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room 	45.138490027596816
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way 	25.88630966878083
but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her 	51.33474646419616
give me farther particulars 	40.6941037824661
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now 	37.82503175942818
my dear hill , have you heard the good news ? miss lydia is going to be married 	51.845465330871264
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention 	74.5805074418736
and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to mrs jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes 	59.151743505696146
and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " lord , how tired i am ! " accompanied by a violent yawn 	125.01081648405545
if she does not object to it , why should we ? " " her not objecting , does not justify him 	53.61919848560451
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over 	137.47017582760833
as that was the case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public 	60.611749659746444
she could not but say , after a moment ' s deliberation , " i am not 	21.95701096751074
" well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " i have no more to say 	6.0923333241718165
" is it not clear enough ? does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister 	176.4487519255583
it was lady catherine de bourgh 	6.828615628807125
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ? he danced only four dances ! i am sorry to pain you but so it was 	64.88306804755693
and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten 	210.87311008950533
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society 	40.38807509703384
he immediately offered to fetch her others 	61.55372191451481
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , i should not pay him half so much deference 	83.61968592793436
" " and have you heard from him often ? " " we have heard only once 	20.970685450610763
as for mary , she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection , soon after they were seated at table , " this is a most unfortunate affair 	124.7616245191223
and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly 	202.6762062446249
" " but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity 	50.89966513556214
" the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable 	62.181453152644934
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise 	76.53137122370836
my temper i dare not vouch for 	28.973781786445606
" elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply 	71.00018413468703
" " well , " cried elizabeth , " have it as you choose 	35.29274719758626
" tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley ' s 	95.6204309078683
a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification 	54.71138223268658
" i am sorry to hear that 	10.847653824496367
he shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish 	58.81136866499712
having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy 	125.95930721081093
your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter 	77.35431117420337
how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family ! when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful 	143.79785458258647
his pride never deserts him 	26.5685620277328
" the effect was immediate 	191.562729596634
their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency 	104.23252276006593
and is such a girl to be my nephew ' s sister ? is her husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ? heaven and earth ! of what are you thinking ? are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted ? " " you can now have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered 	79.14620178302086
and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness 	29.352089086544723
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it 	93.38853370615487
the horses were post 	36.343981837903875
while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes 	114.14383800809901
but still he would be her husband 	20.965593592614656
but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane ' s 	26.24720158154814
but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively 	131.72764355909052
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother ' s in sending it 	156.70241701622007
i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted 	76.59177458981632
had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her 	166.97880045742775
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling 	172.16961447298883
" " tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? " though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question 	129.99692159811238
" " no more have i , " said mr bennet 	12.026251606823168
" it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane 	30.70014677673966
mr darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them 	23.739871243576403
the invitation was accepted of course , and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine ' s drawing room 	80.23832734038251
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before 	62.8248970038637
" it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane , " said she 	25.706943856783585
she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence 	45.87336065560693
no officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village 	357.76719561514517
mr bennet treated the matter differently 	70.81370075746499
he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them 	53.456290208281835
she was overpowered by shame and vexation 	10.45448188178505
" " well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him 	35.07365826025485
there was also a postscript to this effect 	8.98208587984548
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me 	110.37882129386166
there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper 	83.06646677469017
anxiety on jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and mr darcy ' s explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost 	94.88113100263375
four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means 	319.38987397557565
" charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth 	36.36285634309655
not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the pemberley house , is a powerful motive 	112.31439265465403
" " and this , " cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me ! this is the estimation in which you hold me ! i thank you for explaining it so fully 	84.60468388520384
	8.747380749600952
and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head , and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop , or lady catherine de bourgh , by venturing to dance 	51.91928180316272
when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing 	28.19023031645
i have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude 	60.26061844239957
to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed 	65.73984344448085
" " no , that i am sure i shall not 	7.725028451024966
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingley ' s continued absence 	109.72692510796375
" " but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow 	96.17383804530336
i hope there was 	12.90582674248125
but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr darcy returned within the stated time 	187.30444761999257
" " yes , madam , " said mrs bennet , delighted to speak to a lady catherine 	16.587170333351118
" elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them 	81.23165721583321
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again 	80.71147272206066
they have at least that advantage 	33.73611688925001
" " i say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other 	42.73325832851033
but his companion was not disposed to make any 	36.21737146442096
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here 	61.81928993439458
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses 	36.17432744716873
" will she be as tall as i am ? " " i think she will 	53.36904421412725
" he meant , i believe , " replied jane , " to go to epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them 	74.04850331043491
" " another time , lizzy , " said her mother , " i would not dance with him , if i were you 	21.331863986322514
assistance is impossible 	86.33829857674272
but , however , that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determined 	38.5289836377995

elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes 	55.05153958190756

and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness 	37.95886501534635

he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn 	54.746332982193714
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room 	55.04480425586482
when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other 	109.43455238794432

in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects 	114.18032634918993
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate 	369.17435467008465
from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day 	159.7226206360073

their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham ' s extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them 	114.14383054359244

they were dances of mortification 	56.31942774350219
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married 	34.07935388510067
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging 	103.80421380752942

mr darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding 	63.74909538808301
and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together 	23.686174975360345
and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart 	46.55543051382859
mr bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house 	86.8577839494582
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference 	75.78183405285104

and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings 	53.62377162509255
it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise 	84.63476573062624
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction 	37.36465484099163

those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild 	136.2056379416984
but don't imagine it was from any silly cause 	260.2777226927082
i can recal nothing worse 	25.97910135061018
and do you really love him quite well enough ? oh , lizzy ! do any thing rather than marry without affection 	65.97013076056828
elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband 	23.596624380709844
she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you 	76.2569401682572
" aye , there she comes , " continued mrs bennet , " looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at york , provided she can have her own way 	49.21395940725466
it was very little less 	90.13421492612946

in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity 	88.9202625957509
mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , &c 	36.30766972225718
and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , " if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure 	164.94825314709144
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness , and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due 	114.08150702614137
the turning past , he was immediately before them 	74.30623471390587
and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else 	26.356896938302462
thank god ! i have not that pain 	86.59758268186039
" " is this , " thought elizabeth , " meant for me ? " and she coloured at the idea 	43.77303295789542
" when you have killed all your own birds , mr bingley , " said her mother , " i beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on mr bennet ' s manor 	30.114926391487202
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it 	114.75099363688128

we dine at rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home 	146.13127332426467
her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home 	31.569269218872776
" " my dear aunt , this is being serious indeed 	31.764358989975424
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence 	85.29325321053341
if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him ? " " because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it 	174.16414033461376
in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before 	49.32233553270678

mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention 	34.075524124344156
they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved 	88.70886689047762
" " are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? " " i never saw such a woman 	30.29786080179638
i suppose you have heard of it 	16.89276183936739
then recollecting himself , " i will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after mr and mrs gardiner 	82.57570709773057
you provide , in accordance with paragraph <num>	27.660727614389902

" or in other words , you are determined to have him 	19.259414592937922
coaxed and threatened her by turns 	15.290571242552438
but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " mrs bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding 	72.90041598327274
his brother in law , mr hurst , merely looked the gentleman 	50.74265748307688
but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry 	60.46635637141236
such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed 	178.6621736801379
chapter xiv 	2.740340420276896
he heard her attentively , and then said , " lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances 	103.4064437872308
" " and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , ma'am ? " " yes , very handsome 	44.75235380189762
and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , i shall not say nay to him 	157.05064062555692
" " in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either 	24.43315478876972

but i can guess how it was 	20.645638825679683
but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much 	31.15972748291443
" " this is the consequence you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , " said elizabeth 	26.49752884216027

and depend upon it , mr bingley never stirs without him 	18.0269942916091
in revolving lady catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference 	52.18873952501461
" " it did 	10.155790550663964

where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil 	136.7085094649094
" very well 	3.9416306054769548
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her 	63.17112733991974

and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning 	20.020467408668715

but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given 	868.2474270736593
" but , my dear elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is miss king ? i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary 	18.79750984709064
we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her 	161.02822414165183
( by the bye , mrs forster and me are such friends ! ) and so she asked the two harringtons to come , but harriet was ill , and so pen was forced to come by herself 	112.9271469711893
you were not by , when i told mamma , and the others , all about it 	45.25170898313695
from that moment i observed my friend ' s behaviour attentively 	57.35492692680495
mamma would like to go too of all things ! only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! " " yes , " thought elizabeth , " that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once 	109.96699069821786
we will go round the park every day 	33.27944953654916
was not a man to be trusted 	169.32939088341834
there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion 	110.58643849062787
so easy , that every servant will cheat you 	59.11821618013918
and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme 	58.73322689175757
" lady catherine seemed pleased 	11.467861990920051
with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand 	239.7201966656004
it was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it 	75.43322138773516
in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected conversation 	44.982918910873565
" " i certainly shall not 	9.993510183211038
" elizabeth smiled 	9.144932951900259
" you dislike an argument , and want to silence this 	107.61423046170398
and therefore checked her laugh 	72.84048141019794
my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case 	177.7008740160442
but no such recollection befriended her 	25.632400620223304
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together 	109.56425354280171
hopeless of seeing him before 	49.64262864326337
the loo table , however , did not appear 	20.22833767042772
" i do not know when i have been more shocked , " said she 	13.303396048074543
it is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will think of us 	18.093924731287586
good gracious ! when i went away , i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again ! though i thought it would be very good fun if i was 	47.53056709940072
yes , yes 	7.387957280062815
but the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me 	19.882781063360493
" whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment 	77.75102724341806
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs 	100.11852034291442
your ' s , &c 	3.257817285766595
his most particular friend , you see by jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her 	54.40764741303529
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone 	74.9200358378903

and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds 	81.10167372550983
mr collins made his declaration in form 	119.21080099021256
he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before 	199.01174052992937
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy 	35.27837205018273
it is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions 	89.49322981243503
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing 	119.94094505843861
mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to mrs collins 	36.616378429757646
" oh ! mary , " said she , " i wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along , kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach 	58.88277747460969
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance 	154.74426372840625
mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house 	73.86689752500557
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ' s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " ah ! jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman 	122.55907129363761
and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super excellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself 	102.31316995657093
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ' s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters 	79.44181837440244
she sees them now very often standing in clarke ' s library 	103.4134901820413
you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters 	118.09199666547315
" no 	6.973409568568596
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley 	56.609573176457296
she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there 	92.65053508014095
the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs forster , the delight of mrs bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described 	72.10549973258252
" the first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them 	30.42993845099516
i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it 	84.34316368721917
the particulars , i reserve till we meet 	95.72980558781249
astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her 	131.6433138153448
i had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country 	41.87413920705877
at least , you should not remind your mother of inviting him 	31.65954297820495
and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away 	30.971268297173275
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long 	23.514547900536677
" he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr collins ' s letter 	47.898521430175336
i know no harm of her 	14.221794948061037
" it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single 	258.5805413467553
and she read it again 	14.038743839686694
the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground 	43.858426723708156
they travelled as expeditiously as possible 	15.070423120149727
" " did charlotte dine with you ? " " no , she would go home 	27.025736497137157
" " the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard 	28.112375841058284
" you excel so much in the dance , miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you 	55.67016157088266
lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care 	90.25294753329631
those who do not complain are never pitied 	64.83176649594738
having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast 	226.1151733363546
a person may be proud without being vain 	86.49368096626505
we do not suffer by accident 	279.9982920283119
and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment 	45.635401950184416
" and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr collins thus addressed her , " when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me 	106.19040544323747
sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance 	175.07370138356418
i cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago 	126.20799335529081
" " a man who had felt less , might 	28.49075589135191
how mr darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell 	23.191135365693178
who should do it but her own uncle ? if he had not had a family of his own , i and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents 	89.54048719358966
my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! " " oh ! jane , " cried elizabeth , " was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? " " i do not know 	40.41924721123735
she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn , had by some accident been lost 	93.82665054596848
" miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject 	60.34883088679089
nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family 	67.36892166199574
