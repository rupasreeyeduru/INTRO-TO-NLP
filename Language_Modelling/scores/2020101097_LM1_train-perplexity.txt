 he turned back with them , and walked towards the house 	3.6345682606269385
as the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park 	3.7349916027897168
you must learn some of my philosophy 	3.729135971074429
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour 	3.7585980819116926
and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks 	3.8380956762789102
" i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! " cried jane 	3.2649256695416646

london : printed for t 	2.8218322634246795
it was as follows : " my dear sir , " i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire 	3.910615508552478
this was agreed to , and mrs philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards 	3.4420496816915995
perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones 	3.0764093250141715
i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy 	4.18138729908874
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast 	3.3974981262824264
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me 	3.6722442584647697
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter 	3.643186619820117
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble 	3.7163941194918046

information about the mission of project gutenberg tm project gutenberg tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete , old , middle aged and new computers 	3.486051038577216
but to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult 	3.5503981041212596

mr jones says we must not think of moving her 	4.378732759860864
" what is mr darcy to me , pray , that i should be afraid of him ? i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear 	4.141995542342468
she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise 	3.981658853795516
the discussion of mr collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother 	3.7161335108200593
and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty 	4.275878573366501
but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry 	3.600858214028684
" does that young lady know mr darcy ? " elizabeth coloured , and said " a little 	4.32130013352505
it was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills 	3.5166770852221965
and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends 	4.734470906544707
" they were all astonished 	4.280398329175438
" with a stronger voice she soon added , " i have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself 	3.7826572096480136
till this moment , i never knew myself 	4.83252224370794
to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with 	3.6489342627354264
mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all 	3.694624335097285

the sight of miss lucas was odious to her 	4.117249090398679
he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house 	3.9823597782685276
from thence to the library 	6.1705427379272955
" " the country , " said darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study 	3.9355105692469907
" from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike 	3.9801596429987107
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg tm license as specified in paragraph <num>	3.429812984124249
she had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows 	3.703571653708788
and now , i hope you are satisfied 	4.313426935578975
" dear sir , " i must trouble you once more for congratulations 	4.3070282372803605
she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingley ' s regard 	3.5757798739459195
the foundation ' s principal office is located at <num> melan dr 	2.4745020821350088
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother 	4.476290679216556
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more 	4.148782770084739
it was then disclosed in the following manner 	4.73904748276195
" and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? " " i hope not 	4.626867547022714
elizabeth most thankfully consented , and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay , and bring back a supply of clothes 	4.197895614383675
on the strength of darcy ' s regard bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion 	3.9365164380544617
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate 	4.4608352097359
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement 	4.156882105329273
" and with a bow to mr darcy , he concluded his speech , which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room 	3.7879427649074775
the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn 	4.1066737617526075
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession 	3.9670435229123364
your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with 	4.249288303516956
she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room 	3.5427744612741994
and when mr wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration 	3.5485496836161556
and mr bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign 	3.6757184783876884
but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself 	4.6104567213521035
and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr darcy ' s steward 	4.142047276865042
her voice was weak , and her manner affected 	4.425966445069109
it was in the times and the courier , i know 	5.833747208169417
i wish you had been there 	2.9803059300215238
a person may be proud without being vain 	3.8797988118489815
he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire , and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other 	3.7964522423639107
if you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation 	3.396419815988329
they were natural and just 	3.7756811767926206
and then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it 	3.605954913690914
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched 	4.0388227454655325
" " indeed ! " " yes the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift 	3.942361329017599
he then handed her in , maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings 	4.019888132359634
" " did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? " " i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady 	3.0639128850782855
" elizabeth turned away to hide a smile 	4.4152944737366555
and i have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know 	4.27633553030465
and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton 	3.1303406920982346
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies 	3.5006754117021153
but it is not sound 	3.7398097270568904
they were able to love each other , even as well as they intended 	4.000920164995649
is this to be endured ! but it must not , shall not be 	4.6976100568355115
" and then , " said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself 	3.549719392269026
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair 	3.7847777900150126
the communication excited many professions of concern 	3.8453186093357514
that he was not a good tempered man , had been her firmest opinion 	4.736553968804026
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour ' s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment 	3.518834455695283
and , as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennet ' s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman ' s punctuality , both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs 	3.8701949463723344
though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen 	3.6596133367922845
never , since reading jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of wickham ' s meaning to marry her 	3.8845091278213646
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper 	3.261579219390211
" but it must be done 	3.3363354987341634
she was engaged one day as she walked , in re perusing jane ' s last letter , and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits , when , instead of being again surprised by mr darcy , she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her 	3.676910542344329
" how can you be smiling so , lizzy ? " their affectionate mother shared all their grief 	3.140606486381283
he heard her attentively , and then said , " lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances 	4.259870192020034
his affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend 	4.133610409313756
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday 	3.3685036061449742
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded 	3.532569530857317
" " true 	2.910926787581946
by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance 	3.6506342400340013
i have faults enough , but they are not , i hope , of understanding 	3.7508749439887046
they have some of the finest woods in the country 	4.602588684642565
this information , however , startled mrs bennet 	5.614588033503337
i roused , and interested you , because i was so unlike them 	4.0648963439866765
society has claims on us all 	4.471175956299688
but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it 	3.051821973548613
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad 	3.347274362474788
but my dear lydia , i don't at all like your going such a way off 	3.564310016125438
" " but you see that jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt 	3.5357922635116057
mrs bennet ' s schemes for this day were ineffectual 	3.6800488589300575
but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it 	3.388209390372323
elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain 	3.750227426683012
i do not know the particulars , but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame , that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way 	3.961540974997178
you provide , in accordance with paragraph <num>	4.931085421283798
do your sisters play and sing ? " " one of them does 	4.879838520657644
" " i am , " said he , with a firm voice 	4.01484927030763
" the girls stared at their father 	3.807095881508951
he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it 	3.937292114899794
she looked at jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns 	3.336815773063783
but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had 	4.402984686002583
i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , i should not pay him half so much deference 	3.7784138625053934
she saw instantly that her cousin ' s manners were not altered by his marriage 	3.683415343206502
" " it is difficult indeed it is distressing 	3.166908535309154
when convinced on that article , miss bennet had nothing farther to wish 	4.997410562794517
he could even listen to sir william lucas , when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country , and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st 	3.6739368450016685
in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her 	4.447410595939008
it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago 	3.5949990026104794
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman ' s family 	5.275693122344436
" " oh ! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road 	3.741807457867709
they are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line 	4.179013388980083
i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind 	4.626554425958434
" from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been over rated , elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiner ' s long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : " i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars 	3.8188752244812725
he shall not be in love with me , if i can prevent it 	5.1966793240874525
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away 	3.417194997219086
the family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them 	3.9173047073201834
and is such a girl to be my nephew ' s sister ? is her husband , is the son of his late father ' s steward , to be his brother ? heaven and earth ! of what are you thinking ? are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted ? " " you can now have nothing farther to say , " she resentfully answered 	4.231613866211704
" " pray tell your sister that i long to see her 	3.230252733111448
" i am , dear sir , &c 	3.4449166470302623
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself 	4.441603609303284
but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters 	3.091487574708787
but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief 	3.189563719702425
chapter xvi 	3.5396357525995215
" " is this , " thought elizabeth , " meant for me ? " and she coloured at the idea 	3.724176346016644
mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible 	3.8283996917368324
lydia has no brothers to step forward 	4.364093421287127
and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour 	3.9004425268155467
and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained 	3.6431000328878143
and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone 	3.5721982769763243
all was joy and kindness 	4.319274136630004
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery 	3.343293117584586
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one 	4.133287134080823
i hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , i am absolutely certain 	4.158272194520877
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night 	3.476748005009223
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate 	3.650485026270424
she comes to us to day 	3.994641159176357
" lydia declared herself satisfied 	4.004391912588195
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough 	4.034859985916162
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room , i shall be very thankful 	4.041882238368136
i have by no means done 	4.543513730384841
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling 	3.779693671458762
and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt 	3.4479463601398255
" john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us 	3.6329538285132634
this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father ' s estate 	4.2743177154859575
he has given in all his debts 	4.021046077578058
of course , we hope that you will support the project gutenberg tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing project gutenberg tm works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the project gutenberg tm name associated with the work 	3.132084246665018
why should they try to influence him ? they can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it 	3.55456732067538
my dear jane , mr collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow minded , silly man 	3.993242606718608
after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to mr and mrs gardiner , though unknown 	4.242538294118344
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred , during their visit , as they returned , except what had particularly interested them both 	3.3390384118523118
she accounted for it , however , by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn , had by some accident been lost 	4.017731617636315
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton 	3.015199608304023
they were in street 	3.851473256252978
" " la ! " replied kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before 	3.3575251317689676
she only smiles , i laugh 	4.337571395867329
" " i did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present 	4.117050407009578
he added , that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave london , and promised to write again very soon 	4.385941104989134
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it 	4.098229303344603
kitty , run down and order the carriage 	3.6436096052611364
any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year 	3.600546131951983
but , alas ! the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy , received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before 	3.0920487350122325
" you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other ' s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking 	3.3431277318620665
mr bennet indeed said little 	3.9343087931687735
but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful 	4.339844905069317
and the good natured wishes for her well doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain 	3.4380800536502827
you are not going to be missish , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report 	4.376814771839396
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on 	4.369649635874014
" persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself 	4.031253843219229
but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man 	3.513323038053669
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject 	3.6675875115641356
lydia was lydia still 	4.045982068893201
your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance 	3.7772538209468745
and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year 	3.523045171600429
but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies 	3.3861806660412235
" but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley ' s being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless 	3.700351316322545
<num>	3.986380516691557
they are certainly not gone to scotland 	3.1140577739593933
when is your turn to come ? you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane 	3.9584153639097144
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton 	3.6698008790040153
but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr darcy ' s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole 	3.4252104752045343
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingley ' s name had been last mentioned between them 	3.3136119837752536
i am sure i do not know 	3.0930443152858986
and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia ' s flight , on her own folly alone 	3.796540967972512
" " do you really think so ? " cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment 	3.781626471322239
" " and have you answered the letter ? " said elizabeth 	3.04933839629802
" this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer 	4.118413398437591
" excuse my interference 	4.67912833820692
" a short pause followed this speech , and mrs hurst began again 	3.9073713939832055
and when the subject was revived the next morning , and she was again applied to , could readily answer , and with a proper air of indifference , that she had not really any dislike to the scheme 	3.8776825213681168
and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you 	3.7989891107525238
though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while 	4.27106645833539
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him 	3.861016053153621
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner 	4.003912868401803
" chapter vi 	3.9226688759254573
could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes 	4.085332844954685
i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted 	3.803182927551356
jane was so admired , nothing could be like it 	3.7303701539406626
she got up , and ran out of the room 	3.3960503165252547
chapter vi 	3.8875837814206093
and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone 	3.295115781145677
but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day 	3.755577714443411
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted 	3.8126599437747344
kitty is slight and delicate , and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on 	3.7862362126795763
only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage 	3.6821277504671786
" he must be an oddity , i think , " said she 	5.364234811636331
" " the letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard 	5.052003975632333
oh ! that i had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone 	3.873966449632626
well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss ! i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted 	4.584890971800833
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers 	3.714476515838585
" this is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good 	5.074471900027106
however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham 	4.284864999539738
but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general 	3.3800833736325453
they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennet ' s civilities 	3.3667417843457934
she danced four dances with him at meryton 	3.7901290464197173
oh , brother , how kind you are ! i know you will contrive it all 	3.891452215114188
you supposed more than really existed 	4.095371774652735
but your family owe me nothing 	3.8141491154722513
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november , for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace 	3.296498882339249
and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest 	4.089183391569908
but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done 	4.654756227670336
i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her 	4.424941984246834
i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of 	4.063941841393552
elizabeth was in agonies 	4.6535233668480585
" " indeed , " replied elizabeth , " i am heartily sorry for him 	3.5566464780573592
" " you may as well call it impertinence at once 	3.0713913968492155
stay , stay , i will go myself 	5.020711656246703
mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty 	4.24409848265584
but i hope this may be false 	3.7423123347727034
but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me 	3.0443700866033923
it is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world 	3.8523790472825348
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you 	3.7253168336321463
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit 	3.487753339349669
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself 	3.6116403185093233
kitty and me were to spend the day there , and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening 	4.043668751540447
lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter 	3.158040998168568
" kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry 	3.7932743601204004
" i am sure there is not on his 	4.140697781257583
and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared 	3.786001320692256
" " have you any idea , lizzy , who this gentleman is ? but now it comes out 	3.3443047595752007
and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs 	3.1255357069519074
i am so pleased so happy 	3.514553932796917
she will be taken good care of 	3.934286479052942

she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened 	3.7541369256537513
" " yes , sir , i know i am 	3.7804907602877678
here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind 	3.214741593577503
" i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend 	3.2337300242914737
we have not met since the <num>th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield 	3.258004156732212
her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction 	4.170812215015003
but i pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it 	3.7733712247955893
but mr collins , after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will , and should never resent her behaviour as any affront , seated himself at another table with mr bennet , and prepared for backgammon 	3.3702006675821927
" and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you 	4.244384029653988
" i have not the pleasure of understanding you , " said he , when she had finished her speech 	3.413282811891746
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing 	3.776588016140239
" " good heavens ! " cried elizabeth 	3.558464285609343
and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all 	3.2752973638271774
the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure 	4.252047096106985
see <num> h 	5.144557425399287
" " how strange ! " cried elizabeth 	3.200789207523449
they were dances of mortification 	3.6428981658818484
and by that means , as i told lady catherine myself one day , has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament 	4.1055781985454765
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , i cannot tell 	3.397834488292521
" " and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice 	3.62103017473421
it was impossible to think of any thing else , and totally indisposed for employment , she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise 	3.0787037061942795
he merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention 	3.463165551934324
but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference 	3.901089458239297
he will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before 	3.875646259484281
" elizabeth could not but look surprised 	3.1714464968198026
every girl in , or near meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months 	3.6394616891072076
neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane 	3.4641374350554868
and more than once during dinner did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth , " i am glad you are come back , lizzy 	3.704604367388311
were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him 	4.588364900178244
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of 	3.4207757297892507
miss bingley i am sure cannot 	5.182869453909133
" " how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it ! but i wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself 	3.9976430377102705
" this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham ' s being among them 	4.730725998916307
adieu to disappointment and spleen 	4.2861696292929965
you forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if i went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters 	3.9259386201267654
and within five miles of lambton , elizabeth found from her aunt , that pemberley was situated 	3.736247248866299
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family 	3.3827567167608446
perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice 	4.273834967525398
she opened the door , and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " oh , my dear eliza ! pray make haste and come into the dining room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! i will not tell you what it is 	4.095980811947359
no 	6.3930232916528205
he made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him 	4.628299311913682
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg tm ' s goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come 	4.214619138224336
she was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle 	3.934867399891784
and was so good as to stay till thursday with me 	3.8105026949661354
" " they have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he 	4.228294553252963
for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting 	3.733986350731377
our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to you shall try it some day 	3.311258955053767
she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind 	3.6357177284972453
" i hope , " added mrs gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her 	4.116285719580515
though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , " why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ? do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness 	4.368840033232889
let us hope for better things 	3.3271706109067614
his family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion 	4.559599741965766
and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater 	3.844961418858026
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before 	3.785254574055718
i ask only a comfortable home 	4.271393016113247
" how near it may be to mine , i cannot pretend to say 	3.948237092940149
what a fine thing for our girls ! " " how so ? how can it affect them ? " " my dear mr bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome ! you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them 	3.991964280059565
" " your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you 	3.586627206313841
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise 	3.865976468045388
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion 	3.3948120490983915
and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand 	3.596727747072795
one ought not to repine 	4.638199435366483
and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard 	3.780257706823074
" it may perhaps be pleasant , " replied charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case 	4.198640126908392
as they went down stairs together , charlotte said , " i shall depend on hearing from you very often , eliza 	3.7569853279082226
i was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that miss elizabeth bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , mr darcy 	3.5093572508315027
he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits 	4.107648155552906
we must forget it ourselves 	3.7782534706608084
in talking over their route the evening before , mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again 	3.818037209571882
<num>	3.986380516691557
and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not 	3.748373257697401
and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her 	3.779485581633605
but i dare say he may spend half his time here 	3.5226374816812327
" " so much the better 	2.4922272639112566
she was teazed by mr collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others 	4.126425986797438
" why , my dear , you must know , mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england 	3.1414933233528037
jane had not been gone long before it rained hard 	4.203937475181963
" elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " to treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourite of his father ! " she could have added , " a young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable " but she contented herself with " and one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as i think you said , in the closest manner ! " " we were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together 	3.8168413885730117
" after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant , there chanced to be a little alteration 	4.362855585879773
mr collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society 	3.7005442983711796
in spite of her deeply rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive 	3.8897904673116313
till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , " you , who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right 	4.20959686549625
made no mention of the business that had taken him away , and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it 	3.593798546947478
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself 	4.219688127243305
" nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance 	3.938506218934778
she is grown so brown and coarse ! louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again 	4.116983543934178
there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire 	3.2376020405776593
now what have you to say ? " " only this 	4.925646448919075
he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure i never want to see him again 	3.8772236590957534
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered 	4.153665535094335
" " you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course 	3.1985179016830916
and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved 	3.434949243650227
she will be down in a moment i dare say 	4.434245160991562
" my mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at easter , i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh , widow of sir lewis de bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england 	3.6448915028442763
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets 	3.610124757802089
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners 	4.343652378520515
you have done all this ! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule 	3.387712247007491
he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation 	4.126522840112276
if you mention my name at the bell , you will be attended to 	3.6194634221115454
i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason 	3.6750031746528258
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine 	3.774610186549026
gardiner 	4.835894855258233
my daughters are brought up differently 	4.07371621920368

how i long to see her ! and to see dear wickham too ! but the clothes , the wedding clothes ! i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly 	3.3932278902434443
chapter ii 	3.5373847533145772
i must have employment and society 	3.8117447207953608
elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits 	4.963586820283774
i have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for i am two years older 	3.738285952352737
that his two sisters and mr darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable 	4.405350757099221
and when he did speak , it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety , not a pleasure to himself 	3.2339297669611318
" " you are uniformly charming ! " cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry 	3.285159039238536
i never saw such a long chin in my life 	3.622720731775996
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it 	3.986918496349922
when , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in maria ' s astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small 	3.9937327230235415
well , he certainly is very agreeable , and i give you leave to like him 	4.024372318575737
" " is this a hint to me , lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? " " no , indeed 	3.7452023580127944
it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn 	3.4923646631030314
for herself she was humbled 	4.784946180283633
i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse 	3.623766339681981
" gracechurch street , sept 	4.631011749070306
pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town , where the family did not visit 	3.8093525396967913
she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard 	3.378300272775383
she wanted to talk , but there seemed an embargo on every subject 	4.2108340956151515
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment 	3.8390378355750356
he merely answered her question , and read on 	3.610891992599244
as soon as i get to town , i shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to gracechurch street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done 	3.6034707060526303
he owns it himself without disguise 	3.4847219827662053
but gracious me ! i quite forgot ! i ought not to have said a word about it 	3.2223938650912234
but mr bennet was firm : it soon led to another 	3.362164789072857
or rather he has not wickham ' s countenance , for his features are perfectly good 	4.112102947179942
had he done his duty in that respect , lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle , for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her 	3.45162655338199
but his companion was not disposed to make any 	4.1321821435571575
and in her postscript it was added , that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well 	4.011130782778017
jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " oh , papa , what news ? what news ? have you heard from my uncle ? " " yes , i have had a letter from him by express 	4.016588501232704
and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved 	3.707176722160182
it was only said , 'lately , george wickham , esq 	4.752005204806669
they had long wished to see him 	4.210854859789769
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin 	3.8949300327169794
you must not suspect me 	4.146500886574003
while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her 	3.986138615758847
mr collins readily assented , and a book was produced 	4.981884411300513
it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable 	4.215512153846336
mr wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return 	3.516478853485206
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s corroboration 	3.874726780401734
she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found 	4.953303114021609
mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room , and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless 	4.64801836079674
" miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections 	3.2950698643597134
" elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more 	3.3400013748450283
bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time 	3.7425078523563418
" how despicably have i acted ! " she cried 	3.2450139349392986
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent 	3.5904608973546916
if , indeed , it should be so ! but i dare not hope it 	5.111507131844294
and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her , was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held 	3.8643624029576156
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess 	4.288109104023283
his words seemed to imply it 	4.351346910983372
his brother in law , mr hurst , merely looked the gentleman 	3.670102026145533
it came from netherfield , and the servant waited for an answer 	3.8726530987730996
she was overpowered by shame and vexation 	3.026064649528969
and all was soon right again 	3.957490008393578
a thousand things may arise in six months ! " the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt 	3.414500691180079
she studied every sentence : and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different 	3.403985237577097
but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence 	4.080965086296485
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be 	4.253585338349302
" " true 	2.910926787581946
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory 	3.397226301655644
and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town , as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them , on their first coming to london , before they procured lodgings 	4.035346335889276
and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations 	3.9370453312701406
georgiana ' s reception of them was very civil 	3.976074705990376
and the beautiful pyramids of grapes , nectarines , and peaches , soon collected them round the table 	4.312784152882427
till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance 	3.5698559192114376
the foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country outside the united states 	2.8198650961668505
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character 	3.5409904441266176
you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper 	3.7699262224196515
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life 	4.112247895492116
for mrs bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , " good lord ! sir william , how can you tell such a story ? do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy ? " nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment 	3.5430785039562673
a few days after this visit , mr bingley called again , and alone 	4.56404527964228
" elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise 	4.201012910901264
it was very little less 	4.305766871648827
" in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennet ' s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library 	3.8902317277951
but we are none of us consistent 	3.4425305060532514
by mrs hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey 	4.396796416801974
but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded 	3.674549610832973
s 	8.658384774978485
" " you have 	3.5460940334690014
gone to stay 	6.2675789670683235
since the shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head 	4.4587141151393235
elizabeth related to jane the next day , what had passed between mr wickham and herself 	3.599944388523248
a great deal more passed at the other table 	4.096773136878578
they are not married , nor can i find there was any intention of being so 	3.2491659934366104
she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute , and never attended to mary at all 	3.5506026433111693
charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard 	3.5000247688449257
when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him 	3.837268638261495
" " yes , in conjunction with his friend 	3.6643732759909446
they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds 	3.4435493528947996
and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity 	3.659501711760576
her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much 	3.645499514482428
he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all 	4.459725453098573
they had several children 	4.009015217691109
mrs bennet , who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him , continued her triumph 	3.2132436386292866
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say 	3.6873960146595532
" " is it possible ! " cried elizabeth , when she had finished 	3.90996932037338
his behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured 	4.31374505731627
" i do not blame jane , " she continued , " for jane would have got mr bingley , if she could 	4.8266377792312305
as soon as jane had read mr gardiner ' s hope of lydia ' s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance 	3.7128257746264146
" indeed you have no reason 	5.068512444038881
she is not acting by design 	3.4123095435207627
" oh , yes ! if one could but go to brighton ! but papa is so disagreeable 	3.013663331436837
our distress , my dear lizzy , is very great 	4.642966043726527
elizabeth went away with her head full of him 	3.959260489594942
" but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing 	3.3584490663324793
mr collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed 	3.718527731448159
mrs hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently mr darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her 	3.4807017881505784
much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday 	4.188590300556135
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting 	4.423661535303471
but i thought i might as well buy it as not 	3.6836908693487866
egerton , military library , whitehall 	2.2703073829589204
i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings 	4.020949169989091
" " i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party 	3.423251553849527
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! ) on this subject 	3.9206187249535134
and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least 	3.841362425265227
the visit was returned in due form 	3.955105416688085
darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence 	3.9748171548859754
her figure was elegant , and she walked well 	5.129023855746461
but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more i think than last year 	3.3539923055465284
and indeed i am quite of your opinion 	4.549322286519661
" the whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs philips 	4.2830162837066075
he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing 	3.7095545207195912
bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased 	4.376199265644831
and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent 	3.566146468613868
it adds even another motive 	4.18718285965361
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be 	4.06989294625968
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , flowing hand 	3.374567677636403
a report which highly incensed mrs bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood 	3.886454893722672
" " we will go as far as meryton with you , " said catherine and lydia 	4.185811911199832
of this she was perfectly unaware 	4.9685507807638345
" " has she been presented ? i do not remember her name among the ladies at court 	3.8843939781521652
my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge 	4.551679724746622
lydia laughed , and said , " aye , that is just like your formality and discretion 	4.064457936916286
mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking , mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together 	3.5408063772798077
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each 	4.1090259889919585
and you must feel , as well as i do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking 	4.149395051272532
i do not think it is very pretty 	4.64104799118112
mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card 	3.5493256936349296
but now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in lydia ' s marriage 	3.592623140495217
but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them 	3.8462588239337494
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly 	3.529992273040548
you sly thing ! well , i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley 	4.175961730104273
" good heaven ! what is to become of us ! what are we to do ! " would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe 	3.5681720821554315
lady catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew 	3.878846450829005
at present we have nothing to guide us 	4.091159173360052
as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen 	3.9598797883064867
she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry 	3.5250420427716964
and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business 	3.449235888855804
she then took a large house in edward street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings 	3.4060133677063686
she has got over the most trying age 	3.5276964664224066
indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not 	4.42658563372067
her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her 	4.303834262095057
do not charge a fee for access to , viewing , displaying , performing , copying or distributing any project gutenberg tm works unless you comply with paragraph <num>	2.799254792692884
" you begin to comprehend me , do you ? " cried he , turning towards her 	3.4246846503923
u 	7.637805628945122
and though mrs collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as i have often told her , to come to rosings every day , and play on the piano forte in mrs jenkinson ' s room 	3.785543931452514
" " there is some sense in what he says about the girls however 	3.3457922132001814
" wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look 	3.5962479570422694
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her 	3.4151596345305317
but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " jane , i congratulate you 	3.6913614334040434
no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation 	3.969563555160471
she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought 	3.7391809196681494
an express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from colonel forster , to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers 	3.8142975585782026
such was miss lucas ' s scheme 	4.1982542430674785
" you excel so much in the dance , miss eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you 	4.160541912871034
i grieve to find , however , that colonel f 	5.045323832708072
" " no governess ! how was that possible ? five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! i never heard of such a thing 	3.243792102003966
but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet 	3.9618449140714156
" i am not a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things 	4.843929963154156
" " my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not 	3.796168749681304
till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante 	3.8089386420929414
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose 	3.5881535144127983
but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement 	3.077743706216966
you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one 	3.4876651846919127
jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation 	3.453449064078032
do not distress me by the idea 	3.9921772209892086
" it will then be early enough for expectation 	3.673924458675484
at length , however , the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her , and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself 	3.519508107641968
there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time 	3.7708066094104105
such a charming man ! so handsome ! so tall ! oh , my dear lizzy ! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before 	3.698043963613387
mr darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me 	4.296758295882463
she had a sister married to a mr philips , who had been a clerk to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade 	4.120861257757104
yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease 	4.220941651042105
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast 	3.8784033329075434
" how nicely we are crammed in ! " cried lydia 	3.682194147648014
catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort 	4.782633782028938
his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited 	3.5716980974085133
when i am in company with him , i will not be wishing 	4.740009822170777
you wanted me , i know , to say 'yes ,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste 	4.403568421422005
but that is not the case here 	4.360998072237186
elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham ' s name 	4.17343594990897
" " you are over scrupulous surely 	3.2036899227123077
perhaps she is full young to be much in company 	3.890416194291089
<num>	3.986380516691557
" " there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men 	3.5624710960904635
" " i desire you will do no such thing 	3.0979217297582315
my feelings will not be repressed 	4.259563812391807
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and mr collins , in describing the civility of mr and mrs philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house 	3.6948407915920196
their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country 	3.7836052031775282
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more , and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly , there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity 	3.341478243443177
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions 	3.9517667251711575
" " mr _ , you see , is the man ! now , lizzy , i think i have surprised you 	4.075855971536156
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking 	4.017584284279587
" how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! her aunt now called her to look at a picture 	3.2080373913793294
and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them 	3.7389492354245046
and in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia ' s relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount 	3.7280003482467134
for though he was not always looking at her mother , she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her 	4.448410166702865
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? mr bingley will not be detained in london by them 	3.414569045047459
he was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " just as you please 	3.7768740477113565
as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter 	4.275016270176724
" " i should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill tempered man 	3.616684494082157
but the gloom of lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away 	3.511335511564114
" mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how 	3.999789991471623
" " had you then persuaded yourself that i should ? " " indeed i had 	4.334442230408649
" charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where mrs bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family 	3.6588455478739466
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state 	3.685954105510851
and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send 	3.7855783924213897
the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings 	4.1005710878595805
and still different from either , was what mr bennet sent to mr collins , in reply to his last 	3.7634704249284625
oh ! lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall i bear so much happiness ! " she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty 	3.9234471063367
such i was , from eight to eight and twenty 	3.705214138774169
and in the evening mrs bennet ' s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter 	3.5810259952269816
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended 	3.9443528802495846
" oh ! dear , yes 	4.006675110529482
no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after 	3.5696484760182017
" " i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley ' s conduct to design , " said elizabeth 	3.5080683468650027
if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him 	3.68301422888547
the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements , with such news as the country afforded 	3.703034494367663
and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said , " if you are looking for my master , ma'am , he is walking towards the little copse 	4.105299853449485
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ! " " i am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied sir william , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire 	3.627555540763294
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds 	3.794530365855474
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications 	3.283721293560477
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming 	4.612349607504302
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country 	3.6392187690217015
" i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news 	4.072829889752275
when he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ' s not being killed in a duel 	4.143162033102893
limited warranty , disclaimer of damages except for the " right of replacement or refund " described in paragraph <num>	3.475728377418313
and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together 	3.226138983697256
and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments 	3.6952716358727233
end of the second volume 	4.924465161709143
but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her 	5.875559869405581
" " and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ? " " the indirect boast 	3.505978886280047
and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , " pray , miss eliza , are not the shire militia removed from meryton ? they must be a great loss to your family 	3.538690600153485
and if i had my will , we should 	3.894608240527377
they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister 	3.5193237414208816
an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family 	4.320024931934594
but for your sakes , we would do any thing 	4.963221259221768
yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him , and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ' s beginning the subject 	4.842042833440406
and what do you think she said besides ? 'ah ! mrs bennet , we shall have her at netherfield at last 	3.949111599962064
her daughters , alarmed , anxious , uneasy 	3.5490463977324755
at present i will say nothing about it 	2.989774679949375
at that moment , she cared for no other 	3.5742930953352987
you must and shall be married by a special licence 	3.944586408677079
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth : " my dearest lizzy , " i find myself very unwell this morning , which , i suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday 	3.9122060639567926
" " i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man 	4.378430376845863
" " when i wrote that letter , " replied darcy , " i believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit 	3.79923361444543
he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay 	3.881964836850894
mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable 	4.239058924401666
the express was sent off directly 	3.5109161981282955
from what i can collect , he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them 	3.8637274483065935
if , as i conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement 	3.666273144766536
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared 	3.8078212670909926
" " i must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied jane , " and i hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together 	3.5943487988113905
but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter ' s being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with 	4.037292280922717
when it was no longer likely they should meet 	4.5129700991338915
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one 	3.4609701446181624
their reception from mr bennet , to whom they then turned , was not quite so cordial 	4.55712754673928
chapter xvii 	3.5396357525995215
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner 	3.995639532860933
" " to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you 	3.023285243695726
let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood 	4.32122552304155
his character was decided 	3.5551767594767276
" but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state 	3.4489302106338933
but think no more of the letter 	5.240912936757858
bingley was quite uncomfortable 	4.252410589014477
i do not trust my own partiality 	3.9251373309768276
" sure he will not leave london before he has found them 	4.0103490794379715
you must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what i say 	3.0934279270577862
" but it is fortunate , " thought she , " that i have something to wish for 	3.626247129491719
" mrs bennet rang the bell , and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library 	3.468225298835871
and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse 	3.1403879152343284
but not handsome enough to tempt me 	3.6808556476820518
and what sort of table do they keep ? charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say 	3.6548560536887496
" oh , jane , take care 	3.774366207546123
and so generous , that you will always exceed your income 	4.375902355182854
does she live near you , sir ? " " the garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from rosings park , her ladyship ' s residence 	3.843150791321778
they met several times , for there was much to be discussed 	4.011553631631466
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you 	4.428759504382889
though perhaps it was lucky for her husband , who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form , that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly 	4.32493707178581
i told mrs collins so before you came 	3.881980183745579
but do you always write such charming long letters to her , mr darcy ? " " they are generally long 	4.162384828668551
but she would not be secure 	4.880046523282623
" he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before , on his reading mr collins ' s letter 	3.807547884242931
in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy 	4.845650794437652
my father began life in the profession which your uncle , mr philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property 	3.2616282858676127
they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn 	3.2186004510464605
but i am an idle fellow , and though i have not many , i have more than i ever look into 	4.348609800983356
in comparing her recollection of pemberley , with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself 	3.931864305773078
he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her 	3.2494934944458755
lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford 	3.6704079171530033
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret 	3.8069610896691417
pardon me 	5.234707737656297
but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters 	3.4441127000151073
mr darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting 	3.807822654977686
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology 	3.728648243444706
elizabeth was glad of it 	3.502041323025739
" who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? " " his misfortunes ! " repeated darcy contemptuously 	3.7155091198444183
a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance 	3.3508960235036294
and all that i can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself 	4.256296409630564
it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before 	3.969927808301158
on the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks 	3.5950211813857194
such a disappointment ! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! it is really too distressing 	3.532144371854241
her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters 	4.2797044826298105
" elizabeth replied very concisely that she was 	4.467294306499653
they were not the only objects of mr collins ' s admiration 	3.6271741001888076
" there is nothing the matter with me 	3.515304120099076
these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay 	4.169856212782661
his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling 	4.461633047038219
and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of jane ' s perfections 	4.77396669571357
five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come 	4.15199246525312
those to her mother , contained little else , than that they were just returned from the library , where such and such officers had attended them , and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild 	4.026567552997107
for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr darcy were by no means over 	5.0816911451721625
and when i am in town it is pretty much the same 	3.3743794844435606
my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped 	3.6734561640279977
do you draw ? " " no , not at all 	4.000250552965068
" his father was an excellent man , " said mrs gardiner 	4.3667226277439495
and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time 	4.937228528357252
" " in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure , " said bingley 	4.0981111165056925
" elizabeth was distressed 	3.4287311578879374
that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable 	3.6088926183016055
i shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance i require 	3.8422192574977343
she saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers 	4.449127160377039
but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine 	3.9062669814076205
wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her 	4.40074982135789
the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady , to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable 	4.362294171519059
she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse 	3.6681148551309386
mrs bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could 	3.9627769139273776
for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman 	4.79686168713179
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment 	3.575694387949169
" i think there cannot be too little said on the subject 	3.927240561829514
" elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately 	2.9654923966658004
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side 	3.380155314875676
one day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance 	3.8594851202465144
" " oh ! hang kitty ! what has she to do with it ? come be quick , be quick ! where is your sash my dear ? " but when her mother was gone , jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters 	3.391989479487115
it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution 	3.6570889250866063
i am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me 	3.8959072901123712
but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly 	3.4233614085612722
four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means 	3.3601935927806585
but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth 	3.3755359481718608
but jane was to go home with her , and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation 	4.26098919607088
and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth 	3.0136439894078175
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure 	3.970131519330565
without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy 	4.3641169556056205
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence 	3.2944193652988503
but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy 	3.0600920412911465
but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them 	3.3911527626209512
" " in what an amiable light does this place him ! " thought elizabeth 	3.4447751085697655
in future , i hope we shall be always of one mind 	4.5930453780713245
when mr collins could be forgotten , there was really a great air of comfort throughout , and by charlotte ' s evident enjoyment of it , elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten 	3.858063771429625
and you cannot imagine how well he looked ! when denny , and wickham , and pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least 	4.045062879160949
" and rising as she thus spoke , she would have quitted the room , had not mr collins thus addressed her , " when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me 	3.8007016701020007
jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way 	4.774173686844281
i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning 	3.818116438851768
but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as i certainly did 	3.4797699066980243
but the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name 	4.370936175830811
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter 	5.066741834309945
one meets it every where 	4.640033341001783
" " was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane , while she was ill at netherfield ? " " dearest jane ! who could have done less for her ? but make a virtue of it by all means 	3.4657711774884916
miss bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcy ' s progress through his book , as in reading her own 	3.6482741082033305
it is impossible that he should still love me 	3.6202319814141575
i never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united 	4.084421229012138
" miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject 	3.813402672137486
but they did pass away , and mr and mrs gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn 	3.373715690045025
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself 	5.395166911543252
and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better 	3.417267143431162
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting 	3.3592278605622115
i wish i could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that i despair 	4.403727223677965
the distance is nothing , when one has a motive 	3.967684251701158
" " i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me 	3.175168381240916
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission 	3.7781446768768037
but , on second thoughts , perhaps lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person 	3.2468257025028455
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary 	3.472482193105467
elizabeth , however , had never been blind to the impropriety of her father ' s behaviour as a husband 	4.0390998949617805
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous 	3.703237708182696
" two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge 	3.9074702516090842
and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room 	3.3186626327638904
" to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust 	3.5555554231593427
and i know i appeared distressed 	3.95102514413858
they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering 	3.8078916761023835
" " she is a very fine looking woman ! and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well 	3.0727910761587354
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley 	3.100469892643146
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr darcy 	4.095415652349322
lydia was a stout , well grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance 	4.141007659772271
for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation 	3.2549718014212776
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life 	3.3117372597035764
i will have no reserves from you 	3.924759636395191
but these , i suppose , are precisely what you are without 	4.2948484892220185
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me 	3.6948261362767436
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not 	3.7676124500861494
" what can be the meaning of this ! " said charlotte , as soon as he was gone 	3.7086058265077937
on their being joined by mr bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas 	3.7659584946058065
" " i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women 	3.047410599785823
if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin 	4.04095822713859
but i am sure i never saw any thing of it 	3.2826927300446016
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching 	3.351774063690393
and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham 	3.6148416482112795
" with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did lydia , assisted by kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn 	4.042725828169057
for mrs bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection 	3.7834577444543975
she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with 	3.487360297377818
her answer , therefore , was not propitious , at least not to elizabeth ' s wishes , for she was impatient to get home 	4.6406331204913105
for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased 	3.837471018955448
" are you not diverted ? " " oh ! yes 	3.9685956144689762
" " i dare say she will 	3.416024014108257
" this is an evening of wonders , indeed ! and so , darcy did every thing 	4.4671508647546965
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly 	4.22871100129364
he had lost every point 	4.133441855939891
" you dislike an argument , and want to silence this 	3.361200516653327
" in essentials , i believe , he is very much what he ever was 	4.201180231583551
lady catherine , sir william , and mr and mrs collins sat down to quadrille 	4.286969451351786
to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment 	3.5541675454773056
i have not forgot , you see 	4.1291367771550656
some people call him proud 	4.3351869246983386
on the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased 	3.3546411024718186
and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly reasonable 	3.8927327766494195
mrs bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness 	3.143196388352762
it was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long 	4.196870501689396
" " very true 	3.511862169725902
if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long 	4.012422875312126
" " when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other 	3.5516494629988697
you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf 	3.810584226330827
again she read on 	5.206634691717131
" " i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing 	2.8637529455583666
" mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ' s ill breeding , and made no answer 	3.4344045601768256
what is your own opinion ? " " that it ought not to be attempted 	5.283675011337221
" " and do you like her ? " " very much 	4.023244917315994
there was now employment for the whole party 	3.4396573662947962
four or five thousand a year 	3.0526956709478426
and then was enraged against herself for being so silly ! " a man who has once been refused ! how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings ! " she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself 	3.395807792723036
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth 	3.6129413255000027
" or in other words , you are determined to have him 	4.1387972339090435
and the other , how i am ever to pay him 	3.7091913948925233
" here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of 	4.013406537263111
" she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse 	3.8632915581192053
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view 	3.7173206181799423
for mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion 	3.560347604715083
without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person 	4.450118339684425
but since then , we have both , i hope , improved in civility 	3.8905434328646566
" " and what is fifty miles of good road ? little more than half a day ' s journey 	2.807038550606843
and the kind of half expectation which mrs gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing 	3.8942862897552777
" elizabeth felt herself completely taken in 	3.091513446717514
but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means 	3.4368361267566536
i am sorry to say it of them , but so it is 	3.9665217488470708
his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit 	3.7669320993167186
my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself 	3.8092787099877152
but her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy mr collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship ' s praise into his own hands 	3.992323712720282
" i have seen them both 	3.4018425778652603
i know it to be impossible 	3.0985398976240917
mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it 	3.8700479292787957
and thither also went mr wickham , undoubtedly by design 	3.9764507409855807
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiner ' s curiosity 	3.5264823994824384
you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it 	3.8775085604020365
" by this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter 	4.3798584166242644
but her conclusion was false 	3.6654980874363448
he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on 	5.094327715788234
" lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these 	3.4198431886602587
mr bennet treated the matter differently 	3.8012261226708928
he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein 	3.7703789057939123
vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self destined to another 	3.5568042985673176
" my dear niece , " i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you 	3.9473121139368543
but now , as bingley ' s friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me 	3.33290680033926
" " why did not you all learn ? you ought all to have learned 	3.519707487130461
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , " i did not know before that you ever walked this way 	4.280181026134439
mary had neither genius nor taste 	3.7225822662787316
chapter x 	2.9674598914339794
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent 	4.526114694112265
and as she was no horse woman , walking was her only alternative 	3.1304255720716436
in a moment they were all out of the chaise , rejoicing at the sight of each other 	4.101087769423044
it is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife 	3.4843264213778617
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him 	4.192063647383774
elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it 	3.6475037491077824
be that as it may , she saw him go with regret 	4.386713920566438
well ! i am so happy 	5.936142704304282
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related 	4.02819300158391
and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too 	3.4955582854443596

they then went away 	3.87110871752121
what he means to do , i am sure i know not 	4.015873623717206
it soothed , but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family 	4.131918524813088

i hope they will not meet at all 	3.909067135286933
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both 	3.289638556239432
and between her and mrs gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on 	3.939877946201593
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters i cannot understand 	3.4894005943424813
if he were so , they could not succeed 	4.423040389520409
all connection between us seemed now dissolved 	3.840983471866398
he was fond of the country and of books 	3.775700148662078
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards 	3.6549468551707953
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ? they could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same 	4.028750517714142
she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance 	3.7789310801953824
where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil 	3.2994289395140926
and no less certain is it , that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it 	3.8345605548527475
i hope he will overlook it 	3.652069759774692
chapter viii 	3.5396357525995215
" you are too hasty , sir , " she cried 	3.5293324835393234
but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line 	4.582318088936833
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him 	3.2584246370590324
" chapter xviii 	2.7454326203140167
she had gained her point , and had time to consider of it 	4.0262993965533065
" i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter 	3.0030142784873752
elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected 	4.164298998087891
my watchfulness has been effectual 	4.573441255624955
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement 	4.964035824451291
" " oh ! my dear , " cried his wife , " i cannot bear to hear that mentioned 	3.188113394761453
then recollecting himself , " i will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after mr and mrs gardiner 	4.128582372238078
an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure 	3.1721556313028088
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two 	3.659741475080282
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood 	4.290770384511156
but , lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not 	3.5283143050349812
" " if you believed it impossible to be true , " said elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far 	3.756725547670229
for my part , mr bingley , i always keep servants that can do their own work 	3.6577016139857728
he bore it however with admirable calmness 	3.47256350914989
" " may we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? " " take whatever you like , and get away 	3.6578887500738104
but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening 	3.375741839630729
" " my motive for cautioning you , is as follows 	3.442394240093403
" he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped 	5.397354711017404
" " i am not one and twenty 	2.9200748525965126
everything wore a happier aspect 	5.260806882021688
" mr darcy , who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise 	3.428459888298335
" " she seems a very pleasant young woman , " said bingley 	3.696166971293092
she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer 	3.728919351790359
no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed 	3.483673618985576
" elizabeth honoured him for such feelings , and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them 	3.5848056600436307
mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy , drawn when she was only eight years old 	3.8951886073739272
for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived 	3.6241114807367927
poor lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough 	4.12243692239787
" there , mrs bennet 	4.852795617218776
if the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem 	3.341176202549943
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter , and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again 	3.612706803207581
" " take care , lizzy 	4.07642590290909
" " mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife 	2.942306191745706
" " no , no , nonsense , lizzy 	2.8419064758392043
the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me 	4.132831032791176
i can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side 	3.7646144781850546
i shall offer to pay him to morrow 	3.934666857394257
but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them 	3.3902844851598575
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery 	3.8942686119365555
and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age 	3.9169106606446293
but these are not jane ' s feelings 	4.382571191538819
" " indeed , mama , you are mistaken , " said elizabeth , blushing for her mother 	4.947174347765479
" " that is right 	3.3101843894631964
and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future 	3.2202070835364376
<num>	3.986380516691557
but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph 	4.831096156466644
mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction 	3.955345256902866
what say you , mary ? for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know , and read great books , and make extracts 	4.197272123135692
for in a quarter of an hour ' s tête à tête with mrs bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very jane he had fixed on 	3.293462626743474
" " his manners are very different from his cousin ' s 	3.811187866204718
mrs bennet was quite disconcerted 	3.3359629733705534
sometimes she could fancy , that he talked less than on former occasions , and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her , he was trying to trace a resemblance 	3.7670521989196764
nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece 	3.8294028848707695
" mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment 	3.9026806648895453
lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations 	5.5991767886201975
" " your humility , mr bingley , " said elizabeth , " must disarm reproof 	3.411078555410031
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry 	3.2607045598143185
and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man , asked her how she had liked him 	3.6346799760487807
" " from mr collins ! and what can he have to say ? " " something very much to the purpose of course 	4.283629555628196
for his chief wish at present , was to have as little trouble in the business as possible 	4.142699147092104
but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all 	3.9512433493482737
mary would not understand them 	4.253784292045716
but when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham ' s resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate 	3.47738373498891
has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " " your ladyship has declared it to be impossible 	4.079972281093297
i speak feelingly 	5.4385183093260325
" good gracious ! lord bless me ! only think ! dear me ! mr darcy ! who would have thought it ! and is it really true ? oh ! my sweetest lizzy ! how rich and how great you will be ! what pin money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! jane ' s is nothing to it nothing at all 	3.413174194292692
" kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room 	3.411357182910067
how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd ! yet it did , and even a third 	3.8533123037890835
she was received , however , very politely by them 	4.367743211734544
i have not been used to submit to any person ' s whims 	3.4226634490575263
" elizabeth ' s misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion 	3.481295840544929
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister 	3.6945551782042862
but i confess they would have no charms for me 	3.767718791016227
every body is disgusted with his pride 	3.8064524070024808
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance 	4.309749755261421
you must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last 	3.466185297173214
i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham ' s character 	4.025899327527748
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully 	4.227558940403299
she does not yet leave her dressing room 	4.186998548087216
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight 	3.580613137829447
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety 	4.312747055782474
we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them 	4.229330206594656
but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this 	3.201535816651013
" she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr hurst had a house 	3.389354855893559
" " and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley 	4.005283506442505
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , i am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before 	3.8236636546831595
" but depend upon it , mr collins , " she added , " that lizzy shall be brought to reason 	3.452556341628997
the day of his and lydia ' s departure soon came , and mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth 	3.983541193332825
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her 	3.335520243803281
it is such a spur to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind 	4.660405527131796
what are men to rocks and mountains ? oh ! what hours of transport we shall spend ! and when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing 	3.847886217645158
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy 	5.048610546955787
" oh ! my dear lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? " " oh , lord ! i don't know 	3.6422992629945705
and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls 	4.250602271487604
" " did you go by the village of kympton ? " " i do not recollect that we did 	3.704100736842868
but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy 	3.4683830916173473
when mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte 	4.067758029246628
in this danger kitty is also comprehended 	3.6908123833599045
" lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her 	3.511956070774219
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly 	3.827940674855219
when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , " this is from caroline bingley 	4.049068566893642
chapter xiv 	3.5396357525995215
" " but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said jane 	3.3934684298146593
" he then told her of georgiana ' s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption 	3.5610962561504445
lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter 	2.8755970597224207
and be ready to believe , for every body ' s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin 	3.8789642691888333
i do not deserve it 	4.061838925876577
" " oh , no ! " said elizabeth 	3.432800075163344
it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women 	3.5474998427372832
" what would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? " were questions with which she amused herself 	3.18468789689267
and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear 	3.92588784048228
" " what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ? for , though your accusations were ill founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof 	4.100815836701077
on his side even more 	5.045593306806759
i will go directly to mr bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure 	3.9833901728687398
i am happier even than jane 	3.6263973018277613
" elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal 	2.575841585395516
and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so 	4.230335635357003
and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind 	4.405356276479953
" " he is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man 	3.3970970028467926
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages 	3.908439985210317
do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley 	4.314925275504372
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s justifying her coming so far alone 	3.998722108475447
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom 	4.330259275443301
i would go and see her , if i could have the carriage 	4.9584113957145854
he was on one side of her mother 	3.8937839478392484
" you are quite a visit in my debt , mr bingley , " she added , " for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned 	3.7039605174570025
" the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share 	3.2604582808211098
hope was over , entirely over 	5.425725353478904
she could not think of darcy ' s leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him 	4.432468439818538
she was aware that no one liked him but jane 	3.6064536511441996
mr bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him 	4.146672121572228
she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him 	3.6138384090655755
we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all 	4.0438012128345955
come into my room 	4.552886554034016
it is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side 	3.337241240301819
" " has your governess left you ? " " we never had any governess 	3.9847083752204973
" " i should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner 	3.27506317505814
she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression 	2.9861483063882983
and why not to me ? if he fears me , why come hither ? if he no longer cares for me , why silent ? teazing , teazing , man ! i will think no more about him 	3.4754044495662195
" when the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed 	3.3585347803211665
mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton 	3.906228507784695
i really cannot laugh at it 	3.926768257342441
and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married 	3.036475306680249
she performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but mrs bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage 	4.137917347510135
i had not an idea of it 	3.7999761959271168
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them 	4.530103287624437
but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother ' s permission for this address 	4.255427537894161
but with him i believe it does not often happen 	4.395496942255485

" fitzwilliam darcy 	5.292092399136043
unless you looked up to him as a superior 	4.2001972401111605
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together 	3.1084508551840067
" " oh ! shocking ! " cried miss bingley 	3.369478560732594
you may have drawn him in 	3.990435564583112
who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction , spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration , and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself 	3.8737211309859174
" he is now gone into the army , " she added , " but i am afraid he has turned out very wild 	3.295001845751273
she felt that jane ' s feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility 	3.6444929860788333
" elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing 	3.666749201742665
" oh ! yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen 	3.1897327712681505
and mrs forster , and kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns 	3.8570534663015907
his most particular friend , you see by jane ' s account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her 	3.690902596917204
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman 	3.7281742959760376
and so , is it quite certain he is coming ? " " you may depend on it , " replied the other , " for mrs nicholls was in meryton last night 	4.186332682656111
have you seen any pleasant men ? have you had any flirting ? i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back 	4.033987501888636
" " and quite alone ? have all her friends left her ? " " mrs annesley is with her 	3.7294232546354076
his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go 	3.9102895330441902
" elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room 	3.611965451036487
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession 	4.489642983558244
" his being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , " said she 	3.5961216121817894
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room 	3.347914997063527
mrs bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone mr collins began 	3.7385574283914584
this letter is from mr collins 	4.321692710345156
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least 	3.245492995330982
" you provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing ( or by e mail ) within <num> days of receipt that s/he does not agree to the terms of the full project gutenberg tm license 	3.1453940420426525
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great 	4.561173155201288
for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of 	4.0030043885087645
and therefore checked her laugh 	3.786828402952465
" when lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty 	3.6334588733636526
but i will make her know it 	3.7521787701932476
" wickham so very bad ! it is almost past belief 	3.806518813099545
it seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her 	3.6937440168116917
and , as far as their acquaintance reached , there was no fault to find 	3.868420920817576
when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time 	4.26906846260247
and till the morrow , their going was deferred 	4.138572421362112
" " and then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books 	3.8422452221396117
what he told me was merely this 	4.003025265711298
it was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours 	3.9693480216705774
" " you may depend upon my not mentioning it 	2.455528242420634
elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman , who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable 	3.308921790629404
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor 	3.2781490036266616
that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance 	3.655356247359718
my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me 	3.9271800830287757
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least 	3.631419034244936
" " i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these 	2.9281268736569976
and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day 	4.024347168775365
the adieu is charity itself 	4.23440088231047
at length , however , the question was asked by her uncle 	3.366374928353226
" it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now 	3.1365988778078586
and you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner 	3.581363194698083
in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron 	4.116576355711598
when tea was over , mr hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain 	3.405369228170989
one must speak a little , you know 	4.730158704187906
mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , " this walk is not wide enough for our party 	3.717446227928511
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr darcy then was 	3.661574052010909
elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint , being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply 	3.656618112450217
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley ' s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s side , the acquaintance would now be renewed 	3.8574684555306185
" " but if i do not take your likeness now , i may never have another opportunity 	3.9159408677760053
" and when her sisters abused it as ugly , she added , with perfect unconcern , " oh ! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop 	4.934123316487893
mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity , and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears 	4.068063754284181
the promised letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have prompted 	3.4158160390588583
she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together 	4.3248648702517025
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance 	3.563032287191921
mrs reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s life time 	4.516880591631221
his fear of her , has always operated , i know , when they were together 	5.139094138489795
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here 	3.9063877616886393
" " oh ! you mean jane , i suppose because he danced with her twice 	3.208834353693739
but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished 	3.889524121643631
" for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy ' s steward , and of that , i can assure you , he informed me himself 	3.9767983154378874
but i was over ruled , as i always am 	4.595231498924454
nobody can tell what i suffer ! but it is always so 	4.9493989834977175
painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled 	4.429030637279858
he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins , from a conviction that if they saw him depart , they could not fail to conjecture his design , and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise 	3.4659612597290392
stay where you are 	4.120054385445129
she certainly did not hate him 	3.9940444314857486
fairbanks , ak , <num>	4.897286132237974
his sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own 	3.108570873670707
though it was not put in as it ought to be 	4.144422670554824
but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked 	3.88703984173303
as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information 	4.008918639617649
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side 	2.869413324115252
he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask 	4.109806299148514
" " oh ! no it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy 	3.4013294764424375
and still thought there might have been time enough 	4.1330210197503074
he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london 	5.388436446929456
" charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time 	3.87107782301864
" come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared 	3.9653298885594923
but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless 	3.6790697696989736
there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it 	4.3210062056757685
it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast 	3.5342413988147303
as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer 	4.357987735828351
" " yes 	2.5913572305001953
but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed 	3.431431232599616
" " indeed , mr collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary 	3.483797190426599
but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ? all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry 	3.6687159747465947
a lady ' s imagination is very rapid 	4.684011799709005
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him 	5.181649420903931
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time 	3.6989744554959483
and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend 	3.3331232039353162
when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? " " nay , " cried bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning 	4.048612492783527
" well , lizzy , " said mrs bennet one day , " what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane ' s ? for my part , i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody 	3.6408346862341268
" elizabeth answered only by a slight bow 	3.502995741510854
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure 	3.669505089565214
and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood 	3.7277953895560065
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing 	3.5973871081975877
they are wanted in the farm , mr bennet , are not they ? " " they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them 	3.3659257124971815
mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance 	3.5284221608421316
and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner 	3.4215267363556534
to know that her daughter would be married was enough 	4.043099955760416
your ' s , very sincerely , " m 	3.698140898983774
did you admire me for my impertinence ? " " for the liveliness of your mind , i did 	4.309359571502006
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect 	3.677578995387479
mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates 	4.443742630086625
a report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago 	3.482980219016344
" on reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below 	3.461811762006578
but angry people are not always wise 	4.157361779135517
" i wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer 	4.18275222613684
come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia ' s folly 	4.997949804329761
but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder 	4.4045391046388715
" will she be as tall as i am ? " " i think she will 	4.531236412595915
one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to elizabeth , " lizzy , i never gave you an account of my wedding , i believe 	3.9237423270085374
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity 	4.006176988431959
and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful 	3.6121799130896712
mr darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her 	3.8095345216685077
in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity 	4.2016583539735075
her colour changed , and she said no more 	4.770532522901164
with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises 	4.706062645959914
the lucases are very artful people indeed , sister 	3.7761855257829375
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room 	3.372683770611128
she could think of nothing but of mr wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home 	3.6711936230621944
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of 	3.8124210518690287
how humiliating is this discovery ! yet , how just a humiliation ! had i been in love , i could not have been more wretchedly blind 	3.888790323685382
" and that i suppose is one of your sisters 	3.852371675960056
but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last 	4.57609360657942
and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined 	3.5040681072494864
you thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say 	3.7077667268921246
she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour 	3.181798067283881
or at least it was impossible not to try for information 	3.4886266717968417
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began 	3.6390998807890624
one does not know what to think 	3.8174777385308962
he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them 	4.4900412039296995
with astonishment did elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself 	3.9756648074771395
he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend 	3.4756215287952266
" well , my dear , " said he , when she ceased speaking , " i have no more to say 	3.734623118419586
this invaluable friend was a very young woman , and very lately married 	4.350826080989736
and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled 	3.46803374048014
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do 	3.8573339531378683
" " if i were as rich as mr darcy , " cried a young lucas who came with his sisters , " i should not care how proud i was 	3.9704024577186976
but on beholding it , ( for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library , ) he started back , and begging pardon , protested that he never read novels 	3.8198245711340797
when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match 	4.366397058246666
he certainly admired her , and his situation in life was most eligible 	4.9407518839644755
" then shewing her purchases : " look here , i have bought this bonnet 	3.9422694723562417
it was all conjecture 	3.805803654519775
i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner 	3.4473669621289402
her nose wants character 	3.9553054895780675
<num>	3.986380516691557
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball and at this ball , what do you think he did ? he danced only four dances ! i am sorry to pain you but so it was 	3.547801526537276
you do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? " " blame you ! oh , no 	4.514505753518589
and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that mr wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house 	4.101352257664642
elizabeth , equally next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course 	3.2397588868642373
" " nothing is more deceitful , " said darcy , " than the appearance of humility 	4.567096812189675
they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent 	3.930523015846247
elizabeth , on her side , had much to do 	4.0703577942191265
" " i am afraid you do not like your pen 	3.29606898616052
and , after half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure 	3.5676110405238783
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity 	4.104520755646271
on both sides it was only assertion 	4.745626062902622
you will have a charming mother in law , indeed , and of course she will be always at pemberley with you 	4.26970286228593
" " no , " replied jane , " i have not forgotten him 	3.8713537749696996
but you must own she is very plain 	4.029467215770278
" the conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable 	3.3496999310192646
but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way 	3.1098010687488
miss lucas is married and settled 	3.7415715822471065
for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr darcy afterwards discharged 	3.8444994352752633
" you doubt me , " cried jane , slightly colouring 	3.963094704569351
mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage , and when it drove off , elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house 	3.331183795363824
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? oh ! no 	3.4746110759442868
" mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted 	4.294001164697265
you know i always speak my mind , and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves 	3.767983201559005
and she sat down directly to the instrument 	3.884270259733346
but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man 	3.4719170824435044
my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did 	3.765462685041767
nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of lydia ' s infamy somewhat better 	4.405235596964688
" indeed , mr bennet , " said she , " it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it ! " " my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts 	3.6037601002597497
" he listened to her with perfect indifference , while she chose to entertain herself in this manner , and as his composure convinced her that all was safe , her wit flowed long 	3.5390282012352166
" if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield , " said mrs bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , i shall have nothing to wish for 	4.2648413232912965
i shall go distracted 	4.200670488659015
of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself 	3.666662457331466
" i almost envy you the pleasure , and yet i believe it would be too much for me , or else i could take it in my way to newcastle 	4.272152356548009
their fortune on both sides is splendid 	3.905292399711786
" " but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model 	3.3768489237746007
as they passed into other rooms , these objects were taking different positions 	2.836572884098935
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance 	3.351811596268457
it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason 	4.435145510594952
and , while pretending to admire her work , said in a whisper , " go to your father , he wants you in the library 	3.33092236342177
but georgiana would not join her 	4.140004784309892
" her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth 	3.506679296665285
and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room 	3.7706778196383186
i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been 	4.011533187783274
and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire , and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment 	3.6824774867454306
" " my object then , " replied darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past 	4.239420652238253
i am sure you will be very comfortable there 	4.256476911449118
every body said how well she looked 	3.901283279545301
she could not determine how her mother would take it 	3.598716613924743
or allow her to hear it from any one but myself 	3.978597105322115
" " go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks 	3.4716348234207253
we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word 	4.446331308398177
" and this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend ' s anxious circumspection ! of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! " in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose 	3.597074293449968
" " i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression 	3.2502776089855225
i dearly love a laugh 	4.18476484874349
but , however , that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here , i am determined 	3.7049989754974963
chapter xv 	3.5396357525995215
he had rather hoped that all his wife ' s views on the stranger would be disappointed 	3.179733912520569
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew 	4.121186434282542
in lydia ' s imagination , a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness 	4.111366628031064
and he soon afterwards said aloud , " mr bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day ? " " i advise mr darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , " said mrs bennet , " to walk to oakham mount this morning 	4.468102581571246
and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose ? poor reynolds , she was always very fond of me 	4.102086618288264
it now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors 	3.8258882950035353
she now lost every expectation of pleasure 	4.029260964475875
or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent ' s mind 	3.9067805116790386
i hope you have destroyed the letter 	4.33148816498642
and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty 	3.050017354841681
from his garden , mr collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back 	3.75083257981397
but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her 	3.7725698781902612
the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church , and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now 	3.9513621073652696
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection 	3.3149132746403756
" i am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with 	4.246192189320424
" " you must not be too severe upon yourself , " replied elizabeth 	3.5360654187101748
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house 	3.6304048905470783
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane 	4.116970231653314
" " for heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower 	3.7534116758476403
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security 	3.5970657823294983
all were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and kitty and lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot 	3.427718772471998
w 	5.398697534743407
his anxiety for jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others 	4.022522086169168
" mrs gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of jane and elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation 	4.488501584784065
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly 	3.609341013162853
i did not wink at you 	4.654342560856749
she turned from sister to sister , demanding their congratulations , and when at length they all sat down , looked eagerly round the room , took notice of some little alteration in it , and observed , with a laugh , that it was a great while since she had been there 	4.047009233241605
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry 	3.3474037203505707
that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits 	3.8081386366855137
you deserve no such attention 	4.310946395208451
they have known her much longer than they have known me 	3.651619339096336
" elizabeth did not know what to make of it 	3.813217327916238
i am excessively attentive to all those things 	3.7050488057706374
after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful 	3.6918215913109305
but no one can throw any blame on them 	3.2020248694722575
she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy 	3.9792792238491166
i must be in town next saturday 	4.3573302583489895
mrs reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister 	3.4987884300600895
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but i hardly know what i have written 	3.9072195141879673
and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away 	4.707161498809675
so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your'_ seems to have been 	5.209470875372649
" " let me be rightly understood 	3.335940134929492
he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn 	3.05175325586346
by reason , by reflection , by every thing 	3.9767475465862097
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic 	3.7291065953032922
as all conversation was thereby at an end , elizabeth soon afterwards left the room 	3.7454236082277688
it was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more information 	4.150531260737857
" " all young ladies accomplished ! my dear charles , what do you mean ? " " yes , all of them , i think 	3.6424064861782712
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! " " i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love , " said darcy 	5.538598335576836
the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr bingley from your sister , and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of mr wickham 	5.094193305149134
<num>	3.986380516691557
" " would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? " " upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter , darcy must speak for himself 	3.8103646426327358
and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time 	3.0763715166869288
but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it 	3.525858719800505
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived 	4.055192906297754
well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done 	3.7010345136770977
and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible 	4.028316063971489
but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment 	3.8040765296754953
i will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection 	3.3901423508292026
i hoped to find you reasonable 	4.312436651968185
i did not expect such a compliment 	3.650809744305794
two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole 	5.416826126685571
but depend upon it i will carry my point 	3.7898212025381093
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience 	4.25891409626754
and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her 	3.4763598724699207
and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk 	3.98811580450273
i hope we may often meet again 	3.92303616810898
and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave 	3.643107098560267
and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life 	3.9872015009977324
the officers may not be so pleasant in general 's regiment 	3.9838603455863906
" elizabeth looked surprised 	3.674021958304564
" the first wish of my heart , " said she to herself , " is never more to be in company with either of them 	4.379527215620053
he had to be sure done much 	4.888344270527001
" " no , no 	2.731227592654927
and in front , a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater , but without any artificial appearance 	3.492742521175194
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine 	4.0250240469867995
it only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling 	3.358872981722899
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister 	3.9328720057625386
and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached 	3.669987990529903
when her father continued , " you look conscious 	4.6839912803209955
" you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this 	3.590936925395094
but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them 	3.673530297263568
how could i be so silly as to wish it ! your idea of the ponies is delightful 	4.560012800197318
howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair 	4.252740229657582
when a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty 	3.642634992269321
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed 	3.6760990482484694
i guessed as much 	4.839313404092018
and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly 	4.065600846497205
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others 	3.6750565889222564
but it must be done soon 	4.163040888447009
it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men 	3.409634545052524
things are settled so oddly 	4.863569203614356
" good heaven ! can it be really so ! yet now i must believe you , " cried jane 	3.550418062155052
but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend ' s vulgar relations 	4.346815137887027
" " as i did the other day , " said elizabeth , with a conscious smile 	4.3594365231203005
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity 	3.7410895353654454
i know it all 	3.7563881482508377
as long as she stays there , it is all very well 	5.439739959711104
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley 	3.3005385663454767
but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you 	3.6740070130374605
and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else 	4.005356792339239
and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again 	3.5248501570474553
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness 	4.155230970031735
to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed , she soon afterwards said , " i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal 	3.3180681695376193
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday 	3.6253846004527186
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together 	3.8837483713141054
but he seemed to like his second better 	3.897128545272685
perhaps that was the reason of his silence 	4.600933623959593
since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design 	4.007113757210175
" " would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " " he made a little mistake to be sure 	3.953485200483755
but she did weep from vexation and envy 	3.9829637417472337
" " mary and kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , i am sure , but i did not think it right for either of them 	3.6022046108154315
i cannot think of it without abhorrence 	4.095891490399131
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard 	3.758552978375086
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them 	3.35975149220137
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him 	3.1753399697965663
lady lucas herself has often said so , and envied me jane ' s beauty 	4.577274051894813
chapter xv 	3.5396357525995215
when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over , he naturally returned to all his former indolence 	4.009110832196795
it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage 	4.570262956093367
" " it is amazing to me , " said bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are 	4.45628243702407
but so we all were 	4.9946101576616915
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage 	3.4954527791019223
and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read 	4.2700611765839565
as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner 	4.3803806620131205
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match 	4.455359006302333
when i last saw her , she was not very promising 	4.565741037173133
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help 	3.6837529884973317
lord ! how i laughed ! and so did mrs forster 	3.7505807820947767
i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it 	3.431086510697852
" i am trying to make it out 	3.40622685330516
on the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in meryton , he dined with others of the officers at longbourn 	3.7240905503694095
even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away 	3.4685309925365706
elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him 	3.7987721268507526
the far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances 	3.3909603869388283
she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent , and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable 	3.262077306555892
unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only child ) i was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own 	3.6145327251615758
it was to remain the whole winter , and meryton was the head quarters 	3.7548975407664975
" " mr darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again 	3.8888649961957396
" for mrs long has just been here , and she told me all about it 	4.072445629345749
vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled ! oh ! my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? " mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject 	3.903085984094074
any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings 	3.9312748916387528
but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away 	3.4127072115970996
their reception at home was most kind 	3.8045826960356974
her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it 	3.8473128832910755
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ? " elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here 	3.7664992187835535
" " i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , " cried elizabeth 	3.209789122404607
he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him 	4.160726829169997
" " what is it you mean ? " " it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ' s family , it would be an unpleasant thing 	3.480109667888689
the satisfaction of miss bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever 	3.5614999529819538
if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable 	4.231463541833692
i desire you will stay where you are 	3.5324792288479743
for about three years i heard little of him 	3.8306637562472723
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly 	4.18773995300835
" " yes , vanity is a weakness indeed 	3.1610329277584643
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed 	3.385485037374424
" elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head 	3.790034413498272
dearest lizzy , i hardly know what i would write , but i have bad news for you , and it cannot be delayed 	4.829581804186968
and luckily for the others , the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company 	3.7915789288532253
and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennet ' s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property 	3.4938455075802195
coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper 	4.256926249799426
i am sure you must feel it so 	3.5725471342526456
he was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty 	3.2912745831711634
and on these occasions , mrs gardiner , rendered suspicious by elizabeth ' s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both 	3.6544189767537247
many small donations ( $<num> to $<num>,<num> ) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs 	3.6715321815256843
" " oh ! thoughtless , thoughtless lydia ! " cried elizabeth when she had finished it 	3.9718796181114606
never intended to go there , or to marry lydia at all , which was repeated to colonel f 	4.431866664683448
at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting ! i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , i am thus rejected 	4.007227556355321
secondly , she was very sure that mr collins had been taken in 	4.265871442434925
he was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire 	4.487730209415784
and though his pride was hurt , he suffered in no other way 	3.2320856000628413
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support 	4.0884410679127985
and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it 	4.042754769365624
the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed , except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention 	3.735037851745169
" elizabeth smiled 	4.336745235265595
" miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives 	4.507729474523375
and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her 	3.0628640940752385
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything 	3.2302816917486026
" " perhaps , " said darcy , " i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers 	3.7088542132369375
it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations 	3.8411456893828584
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary 	3.419868350570814
pray make my excuses to pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to night 	4.661457175613408
and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion 	4.531010571416972
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do 	3.672410520429881
" " perhaps i do 	3.629459181066305
" elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation , now forced herself to speak 	3.2102242617014762
but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her 	3.706618392209008
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence 	3.6015190185860964
" they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him 	3.5077522550125213
but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue 	4.0107582651563884
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman 	3.557947934573458
" a gamester ! " she cried 	4.138887056199444
my last letter had never reached her 	4.153950947096168
" " beyond a doubt , they do wish him to chuse miss darcy , " replied jane 	3.900354263610491
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which i particularly begged him to do 	4.700156561227638
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness , and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due 	4.029353348192343
as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again 	3.320699700770637
where shall you change horses ? oh ! bromley , of course 	4.181298972849632
" " but upon my honour i do not 	4.1555586650430945
" " i should not be surprised , " said darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers 	4.103051163095447
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness 	3.8472596255742095
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made 	3.9214947815270107
could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ? his temptation is not adequate to the risk 	3.3879437288620724
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on 	3.8927126661942477
" can this be mr darcy ! " thought she 	4.274960485880723
but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , " i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to ask 	3.8207196981728626
but she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies 	3.0973854609829257
in spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgment of her situation 	4.9241165453607385
<num>	3.986380516691557
we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb 	4.704723149778623
on the contrary , he was all attention to every body 	3.4784718783131447
" elizabeth , still more affected , was earnest and solemn in her reply 	3.1905637954275847
" and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you 	3.7383275909430203
" but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , " replied her uncle 	4.900581934192128
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collins ' s side , and as many bows on sir william ' s , they departed 	4.359418927906023
intending to trace their route 	4.804879522051809
mr darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found 	3.773155489881715
your mother insists upon your accepting it 	3.73831711570691
he had been some time with mr gardiner , who , with two or three other gentlemen from the house , was engaged by the river , and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning 	4.013651075403635
she felt anew the justice of mr darcy ' s objections 	4.178409164641083
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here 	3.607858731638066
and what is to divide them ? the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune 	3.6797512183786494
" chapter vii 	3.9226688759254573
and lydia , self willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing 	4.385219870101456
colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day before , not many hours after the express 	3.5216307654361874
" this was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! " said mrs bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own 	3.5965152361769825
" " you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society 	3.392520442608223
" " i am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate 	3.966329150519899
in a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost 	3.542804791432819
you are a gentleman ' s daughter 	3.55520740129667
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married 	3.507419714151834
his society was irksome , and his attachment to her must be imaginary 	5.1046814273650964
mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it 	3.4643842751488663
her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture 	6.2751795220792665
" and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house 	3.445138842886193
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day 	3.1823758158490003
he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided 	4.072425300331821
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy 	3.9216624563699103
but your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family 	4.451733667057787
" i must go instantly to my mother 	4.253716514119348
" " yes 	2.5913572305001953
lydia ' s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter 	3.924032764944699
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself 	3.825880111453598
but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited 	4.577004800555654
mrs collins will be very glad of your company , i am sure 	3.806844436874418
and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual 	4.2391187460862865
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature 	3.6507161682885685
mr collins , however , was not discouraged from speaking again , and mr darcy ' s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech , and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow , and moved another way 	3.770939539494667
" " your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family , " said elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it 	3.941888704135374
at any rate , she cannot grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life 	4.189015823348591
she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so 	3.2708893137893624
and it was not till easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen ' s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening 	3.478025619363553
" her father lifted up his eyes 	4.076694124771085
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person 	4.0979046696675425
and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley 	3.725763478190469
till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happiness 	3.9518130900237303
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation , that he never again distressed himself , or provoked his dear sister elizabeth , by introducing the subject of it 	3.6495798688762897
but , though she could not look , she could listen , and he told her of feelings , which , in proving of what importance she was to him , made his affection every moment more valuable 	4.704067601508527
that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex 	3.5630032921460066
in revolving lady catherine ' s expressions , however , she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference 	4.0409486857878365
and mr collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go 	3.7952254168153607
and she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at pemberley 	3.59837667282806
" " oh ! i am not at all afraid of her dying 	3.7884565482596346
he did every thing best in the world 	3.824139495548074
he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed 	3.52634563964841
there is nothing he would not do for her 	4.1822228247140485

jane was not deceived , but she was affected 	4.112477251255882
" " a little sea bathing would set me up for ever 	3.4117075675728876
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family 	3.952389895172759
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs 	3.4875989143687947
he now wished it more than ever 	3.6675974892694847
" " perhaps we might be deceived 	3.350834916038194

mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner 	3.6765144064367137
if i were not afraid of judging harshly , i should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this 	4.721859616057687
they walked on , without knowing in what direction 	4.263896582648579
" " yes 	2.5913572305001953
whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream 	4.053417170680118
where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself , some shelves in the closets up stairs 	5.075054126099659
it was hardly enough 	4.038747441678266
" she was gone directly 	4.3262935982949084
whether he had been aware of jane ' s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation 	4.110106057931305
no officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village 	3.347558117414165
you do not know what he really is 	4.211131202277438
her ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them 	3.4326416049637323
but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you 	3.5511512749571854
lady catherine rose also , and they turned back 	4.67459093356074
" i found , " said he , " as the time drew near , that i had better not meet mr darcy 	3.641580897629062
elizabeth would not observe her 	4.202823421738141
the evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary 	4.105268765888922
my father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be 	3.4692635112530965
james ' s 	3.3928607133246973
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it 	3.9602073381229346
" " some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me 	3.8568552469725317
" " dear madam , " cried mrs hill , in great astonishment , " don't you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner ? he has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter 	3.459668133305075
if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight 	4.71081677062753
" i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do 	3.8076337602266905
" charlotte ' s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth 	3.5473992630005657
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life 	3.3726033316644766
you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert 	3.3818168673622475
lady catherine de bourgh ' s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable 	3.241100922770369
but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to 	3.452810424075394
and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london 	3.502112553160141
the rector of a parish has much to do 	3.5500216738590717
and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion 	3.7100545428279044
elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked 	4.304668693726114
he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate , generous heart in the world 	3.342497455716276
elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations 	3.27027283929578
and what claims has lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge 	3.4521967391949775
" " you did ! and it was not wholly without foundation 	4.158842902408654
there can be no occasion for your going so soon 	3.167828389193644
and that his character was by no means so faulty , nor wickham ' s so amiable , as they had been considered in hertfordshire 	3.7417623517028544
he is perfectly amiable 	4.1664466623731515
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more 	3.6710296831176703
" mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? poor eliza ! to be only just tolerable 	3.334240966785481
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice 	3.250397052520249
one knows exactly what to think 	3.7807058289215076
he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther 	3.5406862456465085
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend 	3.0120882740571133
i know we dine with four and twenty families 	3.3920447555747177
" my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way 	3.8999359333043664
for mine is totally different 	4.264002516188234
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression 	2.9931804132768307
for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to mr bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at hunsford 	4.197483168540685
though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form , he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing 	4.3887596480827265
the second began 	5.048120307232231
and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so good humoured as lydia 	3.4795321638275354
she asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s maiden name ? elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly 	3.662960458975863
" mr collins had a compliment , and an allusion to throw in here , which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter 	3.4729783910248817
and their mother ' s fortune , though ample for her situation in life , could but ill supply the deficiency of his 	4.261864739945164
and elizabeth began to like them herself , when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane 	3.5643413744988126
mr collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune 	3.28967881000139
but let me advise you to think better of it 	3.6301629666399684
he meant to resign his commission immediately 	4.380198480235855
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room 	3.542537210646345
" " i am sick of mr bingley , " cried his wife 	4.082983707364386
and , at last , on the young lady ' s whispering to elizabeth again , he walked away 	4.842878339859084
when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen 	4.136075619691739
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for 	3.64402620592697
i beg you will not go 	5.2803805263652785
" i should like to know how he behaves among strangers 	3.673657016755421
i shall be back by dinner 	3.8326990563103847
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter 	3.8449669307898895
" perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one ' s neighbours 	3.9095831485715324
at first there seemed danger of lydia ' s engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker 	4.19264419884219
all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return 	3.8789571559744798
they lagged behind , while elizabeth , kitty , and darcy , were to entertain each other 	3.5634570166623534
" " very true , my dear , that is exactly what i say 	3.424594474308547
as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following manner : " you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither 	3.4109370109595103
but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , " come here , my love , i want to speak to you , " took her out of the room 	3.696463104896303
" darcy mentioned his letter 	4.064192386278937
	8.166004683736908
i will speak to her about it myself directly 	3.8370282844531385
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command 	3.3432291340710516
i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses 	3.0938925275592184
i feel as if i had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve 	3.883585911930782
" elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs 	4.208004877294163
" " but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about 	3.464601523514801
a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room 	3.549907613528376
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished 	3.880029239610035
" my dear madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive 	3.6503770967055065
the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention 	3.8272745260283325
for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power 	4.413452947756969
in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else , and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room 	3.1577372139580775
and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling 	3.682382168195587
mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk 	3.482079066551346
" " i beg you would not put it into lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill treatment 	3.087563989239925
dear , dear lizzy 	5.7782551251291565
she liked him too little to care for his approbation 	3.8685946822590753
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost 	3.8730168290726152
" oh ! my dear mr bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball 	3.6908643414898012
and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it 	4.0355815711104315
when coffee was over , colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him 	3.6759099595703812
" " you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner 	3.3108289439272336
it is every way horrible ! " darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence 	3.7585431958685507
it is evident that you belong to the first circles 	3.5909774966354755
if she does not object to it , why should we ? " " her not objecting , does not justify him 	4.228496244523597
and i think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s 	3.3538644693397157
" the wedding took place 	3.4521139519223087
" he is indeed but considering the inducement , my dear miss eliza , we cannot wonder at his complaisance 	3.337138496581679
she looked forward to their entrance , as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend 	3.7532585280885002
but you have chosen your fault well 	3.3400673819446256
" " so much the better 	2.4922272639112566
he was well , but so much engaged with mr darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him 	4.642698757843523
and if she were married to him to morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth 	3.878040713324556
" elizabeth made no answer , and walked on , her heart swelling with indignation 	3.1261583225410825
" " if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is , i shall know what to think 	3.560100215837399
nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant 	4.218859595271329
all that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the london road 	3.9039980564689976
there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance 	3.711869688355259
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity 	3.718648689013318
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king , during his mayoralty 	3.812233114977418
" miss bennet paused a little and then replied , " surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully 	3.1244307633583546
he studies too much for words of four syllables 	3.9218692398120676
my good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible 	4.412193531969289
it was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her 	4.232953598095738
" chapter xxi 	2.7454326203140167
and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world 	3.35962385500951
" my dear friend , " if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day ' s tête à tête between two women can never end without a quarrel 	3.601666600463502
" " how hard it is in some cases to be believed ! " " and how impossible in others ! " " but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge ? " " that is a question which i hardly know how to answer 	3.6582397238078777
a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it 	3.4677474832990485
i do comprehend a great deal in it 	3.729535577786615
in a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account 	3.768398036578076
" it was some time , however , before a smile could be extorted from jane 	4.606101406549237
but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome 	3.1920063427608887
royalty payments must be paid within <num> days following each date on which you prepare ( or are legally required to prepare ) your periodic tax returns 	3.1821876127538697
" " i beg your pardon 	2.3899374539546137
that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy ! that he should have been in love with her for so many months ! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend ' s marrying her sister , and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case , was almost incredible ! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection 	3.909964698630756
you have employed your time much better 	3.5723243227169017
lady catherine then observed , " your father ' s estate is entailed on mr collins , i think 	4.231534130143992
our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself 	3.4499892664982412
the loo table , however , did not appear 	4.6013865486273975
and in this early example of what lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business 	3.334038812151216
but why did not you tell me so before ? if i had known as much this morning , i certainly would not have called on him 	3.9485456942597628
there was no want of discourse 	3.467232951017493
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility 	3.7668518742546975
" " you go to brighton ! i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds ! no , kitty , i have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it 	3.7053836705142222
smiles decked the face of mrs bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door 	4.106499988716479
but you know married women have never much time for writing 	3.3850736920712285
at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance 	5.069229855828222
this was exactly as it should be 	4.5077309946549695
" " all this she must possess , " added darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading 	4.132039091040238
" i am sure , " said she , " i cried for two days together when colonel millar ' s regiment went away 	3.245624580041256
" well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " what say you to the day ? i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you 	3.7078455105425587
chapter vii 	3.8875837814206093
and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement 	3.654744165209231
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met 	4.030792575840288
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship 	3.3424362703962776
her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted 	5.305034398483221
" this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted : and elizabeth , rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself , soon went away 	3.5883854590942694
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning 	3.5945501982901273
the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all miss bingley ' s witticisms on fine _ 	4.524900968438084
" and she rose as she spoke 	3.7630748192229415
and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down stairs from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her 	3.341378136788247
not that i am afraid of myself , but i dread other people ' s remarks 	4.215540856238961
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself 	3.4976985510747816
but in matters of greater weight , i may suffer from the want of money 	3.669965079110287
" upon my word , " said mrs gardiner , " i begin to be of your uncle ' s opinion 	4.279695431590687
" i , who have prided myself on my discernment ! i , who have valued myself on my abilities ! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust 	3.438904717498759
i only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it 	3.6454733183642998
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends 	3.858649398366566
names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony 	5.835078949639796
" mr darcy ' s letter to lady catherine , was in a different style 	3.9928416408189853
you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me 	3.6963606516148015
there can be no love in all this 	3.5925464812287156
and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille , while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh ' s foot stool , that she said , 'mr collins , you must marry 	4.023038681851083
i often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice 	4.601376251356106
you must send john with the young ladies , mrs collins 	4.090688839302029
mrs gardiner and her niece , however , did her justice , and pitied her 	3.6128389917637724
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in kent ? " " i have heard from authority , which i thought as _ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron 	3.9846126472202954
" he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton 	3.658979496780551
" " she had better have stayed at home , " cried elizabeth 	3.76897116529256
let me hear from you very soon 	3.8030241974961547
he actually danced with her twice 	3.2767433813659927
i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer 	3.170547712952543
mrs hurst thought the same , and added , " she has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker 	4.422493401806944
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of hertfordshire 	3.4348945003110685
mr bingley was good looking and gentleman like 	3.5179350083373637
had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it 	3.555320956948818
it cannot be concealed from any one 	3.848701027495957
put them next to your great uncle the judge 	4.1324232684772895
" " after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion 	3.290073152748288
" they have both , " said she , " been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea 	3.9668224778741434
she was immediately told , that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence 	3.8658574352441977
he took the hint , and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " that will do extremely well , child 	3.5062834674434376
a lively imagination soon settled it all 	3.8719629134231086
and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her 	3.842342857354133
" " that is very strange 	3.10196673405126
but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine ' s drawing rooms , and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room 	3.287408593391107

how you must have hated me after that evening ? " " hate you ! i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction 	3.9484565777476472
" this is wholly unexpected 	3.77986710054726
and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister 	3.421393128194255
every savage can dance 	4.2823816064836855
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood 	3.7023509533541676
it was mr collins ' s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened 	3.6489406136991125
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me 	3.167786389848158
but good lord ! how unlucky ! there is not a bit of fish to be got to day 	3.294717014042721
they travelled as expeditiously as possible 	4.504667708541599
i came to you without a doubt of my reception 	4.0982100435304005
and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned 	3.82732122503447
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine , and her daughter 	4.125833024002261
and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon 	3.6542058286165826
have you never happened to see her there ? " she was perfectly sensible that he never had 	4.4984867124102506
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard 	3.703172819260038
and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness 	4.151468435161229
" you may well be surprised , miss bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday 	3.8442863661944484
advised her to return to bed , and promised her some draughts 	4.464295276777023
determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female 	4.245204593757337
but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere 	3.281777982451358
but at length , by elizabeth ' s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation 	3.6183999168467307
she directly replied , " you need not be frightened 	5.199786530231139
the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first 	3.8923197045573183
to elizabeth , however , he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed 	4.126641570264469
this mrs younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham 	3.8195722167608364
they were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain 	3.6150487874269728
mrs bennet treasured up the hint , and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married 	3.6716520628674854
and his civilities were worn out like his information 	3.577894189636306
and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended 	3.5695266275778805
he was moving that way 	3.5149546075812115
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister 	3.5846854918076936
" " is that his design in settling here ? " " design ! nonsense , how can you talk so ! but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes 	3.9853122327548904
" lizzy , " said he , " i was going to look for you 	3.910976745810806
what did colonel forster say ? had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ? they must have seen them together for ever 	3.5339780298215686
but if i go on , i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem 	3.7293166822928585
his brow contracted , his air gloomy 	3.619876336506134
" " thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me 	3.29572139557324
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either 	3.8595632178813175
you have a sweet room here , mr bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk 	3.84727871601256
but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he likes it 	4.3477711578579115
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party 	3.5463460931317834
" elizabeth almost stared at her 	3.6327451388873726
i was ready to die of laughter 	3.771893205859309
perhaps i am not doing her justice 	4.724131961749651
fatigued as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance 	4.129172860542599
" she replied , endeavouring to recover herself 	3.472008639901248
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn 	3.2772911228821466
and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination 	3.7193663338045835
his marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " wished they might be happy 	3.7347538485580065
but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure 	3.7151287429621953
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others 	3.583013035286772
and when at length they turned in at the lodge , her spirits were in a high flutter 	2.949603345721748
mr darcy was almost as far from her , as the table could divide them 	4.21115657879503
mrs bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else , for half an hour 	3.213139269503418
and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife 	3.836973756136925
" he only told me , what i have now told you 	4.085202627831145
" and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable 	3.2802713486558743
mrs bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast 	3.4805684808727366
" " poor wickham 	3.8919372135023074
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did january and february pass away 	3.488212668376469
i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her 	3.5188217162242865
" " you have a house in town , i conclude ? " mr darcy bowed 	3.5010130943104936
and as for purvis lodge , the attics are dreadful 	4.098465869055306
for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight 	3.7601388723553066
to the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingley ' s , she could not make a very favourable answer 	3.938685570432122
at present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood 	3.572726495728079
indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them 	3.7150891476257777
i was sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her 	3.7625939704160705
she watched him whenever they were at rosings , and whenever he came to hunsford 	3.9446316235976076
she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " this must be false ! this cannot be ! this must be the grossest falsehood ! " and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again 	3.814145445400733
" " can i have the carriage ? " said jane 	4.118216085875277
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman 	3.9685900453478737
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet ' s height , or rather taller 	3.819886359421093
it settled the matter 	4.603768538985663
" " what should not you mind ? " " i should not mind any thing at all 	3.3236147076388804
" " i am sure i know none so handsome 	2.971962667864752
there is but such a quantity of merit between them 	4.1441692078377015
" elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry 	3.2760476195623656
and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation 	3.848916125831316
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents 	4.992306776633068
but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed 	3.8854536942113924
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast 	3.843029187737124
but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness 	3.704320852105213
allowing for the common demands of the game , mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy 	4.270142722808161
pray go to see them , with sir william and maria 	4.516292791631918
they had nothing to accuse him of but pride 	3.6137597881958636
the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation 	3.657415499975591
and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty 	4.138795547612549
to mrs gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers 	4.035197279817135
the turning past , he was immediately before them 	4.552710921431484
he cannot know what mr darcy is 	5.038545575612718
" but it is , " returned she 	3.778085084909263
we now come to the point 	4.251694807400959
and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity 	3.7712333940935396
such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly 	4.113840475551012
chapter xi 	3.5396391012611037
was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth 	4.189426888060466
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better 	3.572734440289496
" i see your design , bingley , " said his friend 	4.022231623448166
" she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her 	3.54004198704207
" " how can you talk so ? " said jane faintly smiling , " you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could not hesitate 	3.847105942540987
he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump 	3.9233950218376514
with assumed tranquillity he then replied , " i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success 	4.0145133315390815
as for your elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? " " it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied 	3.9332411121900344
neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable 	4.233516250836708
and fearful of its being mr darcy , she was directly retreating 	5.104813338361048
and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side 	3.8668585404957625
" and gravely glancing at mr darcy , " there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with 'keep your breath to cool your porridge ,' and i shall keep mine to swell my song 	3.4685163175788807
" darcy made no answer , and seemed desirous of changing the subject 	3.1669740966366766
for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them 	4.475996983718037
lydia ' s being settled in the north , just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company , for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire , was a severe disappointment 	4.132535023130843
" " but you will know it , when i have told you what happened the very next day 	3.672381110268934
it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment 	3.364624548081787
he had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them 	3.950244273565488
" they are married ! " elizabeth read on 	3.706546059331931
and know them to be so much attached to me ! they were excessively sorry to go ! but so they always are 	3.831105362489468
they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all 	5.547579263232114
they look upon it quite as their own , i dare say , whenever that happens 	3.8659213221311877

my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i can't write 	4.829960295389847
elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased 	4.250818553721466
and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante 	4.1689791798823554
i have met with two instances lately 	3.7543325452762
by this time she is actually with them ! if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! " " we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said jane : " i hope and trust they will yet be happy 	3.804238183240022
but ashworth is too far off ! i could not bear to have her ten miles from me 	3.8403143733861302
" " remember , eliza , that he does not know jane ' s disposition as you do 	4.796354037788348
but that is what a governess will prevent , and if i had known your mother , i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one 	3.790246763038029
one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief 	4.8522931185842015
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other 	3.8230654825548025
but now as the first shock is over , shall i own that i long for your return ? i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient 	4.588841620409991

" " that is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily 	3.982809282411547
elizabeth was surprised , however , that wickham should consent to such a scheme , and , had she consulted only her own inclination , any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes 	4.028731584123916
but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side , i hope it will not be long before they are 	3.922639513495845
" her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained 	3.4989928277844364
you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it 	3.4309710603960317
if you should have no objection to receive me into your house , i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family , monday , november <num>th , by four o'clock , and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se'night following , which i can do without any inconvenience , as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday , provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day 	3.028297015271237
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth 	4.377593099776789
" but it is wholly out of my power 	3.7901758584937633

i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment 	3.193007266809666
and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day 	4.329433583999585
mr gardiner was a sensible , gentleman like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education 	3.752625375674734

" very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that 	4.781701647285198
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together 	4.744216003237542
elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth 	4.703400348107401
that is all settled 	4.349894626686136
" this roused a general astonishment 	3.7099211899665474

my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken 	3.970894257709759
but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her 	3.5088303288365625
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this 	3.409256827738375
" so , lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love i find 	4.426815850949074
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking 	3.9801989498361188
and if you are not kind to us , brother , i do not know what we shall do 	3.926323229908068

and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected 	3.570321001049571
" " unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do 	3.748364665305978
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her 	3.9510091525405846
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that she would not give into it 	4.000360771503383
" " i believe , ma'am , i may safely promise you never to dance with him 	3.388738371529989

with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed 	3.335260079045619
" " if ! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ? do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? " " i never heard that it was 	4.023856084179943
" " mr darcy is not to be laughed at ! " cried elizabeth 	3.1713988469925836
this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter , had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance 	3.808606284752805
gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness 	3.419266819145757

but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas 	3.3818579016797385
mr bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before 	3.7954162849487076

" " if you mean darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing 	4.3352929036939365
" " i am not now to learn , " replied mr collins , with a formal wave of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour 	4.000976309001005
but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself 	4.587340702814725
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names 	3.7479672115186404
nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit 	3.8116894343987866
for my part , i am inclined to believe it all mr darcy ' s , but you shall do as you chuse 	3.857639525429559
there was no help for it however 	3.8300303580361743
mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ' s active superintendance , and when immediately before my father ' s death , mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself 	3.9267210127011447
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while 	3.8520530617648605
he is , indeed 	4.450328737800907
" " you may depend upon it , madam , " said miss bingley , with cold civility , " that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us 	3.302599123148299
the dinner was exceedingly handsome , and there were all the servants , and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised 	4.281000635976101
and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody 	3.439019436144059
she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary 	4.136345807453754
" if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside , " cried bingley , " it would not make them one jot less agreeable 	5.047446421789003
the dejection was almost universal 	4.40595168997428
a little time therefore 	4.633534174118712
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character 	3.29091276676188
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern 	3.768337430338884
but you do not know all 	5.155945800858639
her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone 	3.9235805312862064
but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin 	4.016592677129268
or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance 	4.61721293246144
" " aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and mrs long does not come back till the day before 	3.4780741410009504
i have a high respect for your nerves 	3.4212703384530654
" " really , mr collins , " cried elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me exceedingly 	4.703018355595753
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling 	3.53747232940003
" then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson 	3.2361600163965454
" " well , all i know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him 	4.008931896814479
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect 	3.7126386648581926
this however was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough 	3.956487421929283
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true 	3.6939436079763266
she looked at jane , to see how she bore it 	3.474319233674944
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again 	4.7685197234073335
allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , ( glancing at her sister and bingley , ) shall take place 	3.905110156765437
but i suppose you had no opportunity 	4.724760962749561
they are even impartial towards miss king 	3.809414484267175
mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , paid his compliments , with his usual reserve , to mrs collins 	3.3742784815644997
and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all 	4.26653609435695
every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth 	3.6999561156249223
" elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand 	3.458220806268365
" mr darcy smiled 	3.9249373162729055
though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to you 	4.103837139560421
i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it 	3.9252856081544287
" she is a great deal too ill to be moved 	3.7082000173275023
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself 	3.8476470434727292
and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement 	4.143585139712121
" " do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? " " sometimes 	3.8093209292398758
he had felt their importance in the family circle 	4.251529087554934
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable 	3.579420121947574
" it has been a very agreeable day , " said miss bennet to elizabeth 	4.624760155981409
" he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town 	3.9150963643896817
" and certainly ought not to have appeared 	3.788916418422109
and after some contrivance , the whole party , with all their boxes , workbags , and parcels , and the unwelcome addition of kitty ' s and lydia ' s purchases , were seated in it 	4.336426966328056
" you have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty 	3.9644022795952045
" " yes 	2.5913572305001953
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth 	3.8968861960255476
and i should be miserable to forfeit it 	4.116026727692808
her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much 	3.4886518675093496
elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend 	4.779670208577877
so , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next 	3.8733510953789656
if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all 	4.200535010002889
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent 	3.822858075809166
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible 	4.698074305101416
my sisters may write to me 	4.128372931966324
" " you are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body ! if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers 	3.364728410798297
it was some days , however , before they received any invitation thither , for while there were visitors in the house , they could not be necessary 	3.7588922687002455
" but i can assure you , " she added , " that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy 	3.687937245345786
" on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away 	3.416150542490067
i 	5.149475509988577
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible 	4.129520091431005
other schemes too came into her head 	4.290350812974672
and the valley , here contracted into a glen , allowed room only for the stream , and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it 	3.965390580463554
" " she will drop the acquaintance entirely 	3.494932516258661
<num>	3.986380516691557
on opening the door , she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation 	4.499312550643998
" " will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again ? at present i have not room to do them justice 	3.5432001686156083
bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter 	3.65834605420038
it is not quite a week since they left brighton 	3.709850564524445
it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush 	3.8536119268477376
elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect 	3.799723483734179
in pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered meryton 	3.510117115600964
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty 	3.8995337518237148
as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty 	4.896317709054514
and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves 	3.2085432078963727
that he was surprised by the connexion was evident 	5.559940026509586
and mrs hurst , principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings , joined now and then in her brother ' s conversation with miss bennet 	3.856559585239541
and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter 	3.302774343301503
i was only confused for the moment , because i felt that i should be looked at 	4.234890036229197
the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken 	4.065613392327766
that is my idea of good breeding 	3.9235644510432524
and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced 	3.1637761077735687
but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father 	3.89436774309996
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him 	3.792635537520309
i do not know what to say to you 	3.1239030416816767
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side , too , was another very welcome surprise 	3.616521625851938
project gutenberg is a registered trademark , and may not be used if you charge for the ebooks , unless you receive specific permission 	3.568897206248992
there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors 	3.6938956575746023
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw 	3.464133256939705
but i will no longer importune my young cousin 	3.653035037604811
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once 	3.9974738403203136
he left netherfield for london , on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning 	4.457522074657101
the park was very large , and contained great variety of ground 	3.1894749360702233
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth 	3.8819202728178803
and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence 	3.4333899251288105
and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city 	3.9473800034453377
and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern 	3.50797319075705
nor will i be dissuaded from it 	4.242275697404483
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way 	4.126550263724066
but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him 	4.378133592715355
he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend 	4.13565516356138
every thing being settled between them , mr darcy ' s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home 	4.1113106284446115
as a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me 	3.8417976202135464
sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man 	3.7758135572590046
the day passed most pleasantly away 	3.2735828736491546
but i am particularly attached to these young men 	3.3842615694588045
" " did charlotte dine with you ? " " no , she would go home 	4.0329288664345215
the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before , and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon 	3.5648066742009394
" no , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain 	3.954700423808189
" " but not before they went to brighton ? " " no , i believe not 	4.025047586637241
but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane ' s 	3.971090223163699
nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion 	3.476849845937122
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton 	3.3491040816327176
his letter was soon dispatched 	4.680085148953885
for what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? " " oh ! " cried elizabeth , " i am excessively diverted 	3.655719547040036
but respecting his abilities , and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself , she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook , and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which , in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children , was so highly reprehensible 	3.6307551889591956
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent 	2.947813184299181
he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family 	4.311125721740762
their brother , indeed , was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency 	4.983237246595771
" elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her 	3.513088460554166
but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise 	3.547521418345875
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself 	3.3973589372378195
i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy 	3.3063992693706883
and then rising up , said to elizabeth , " miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn 	4.180383277891433
and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation 	3.515197535988314
and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by wickham 	4.26250142540063
" my dear brother , " at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope will give you satisfaction 	3.2834433173598496
there was also a postscript to this effect 	3.1682973137314137
" but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope every thing will be well 	4.19012153368686
" " but he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather ' s death made her mistress of this fortune 	3.6692241085308774
for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother ' s hands , lydia ' s expences had been very little within that sum 	4.044298423689618
nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been 	4.135090655008078
give my love to colonel forster , i hope you will drink to our good journey 	4.125915141902529
she answered him in the usual way , and after a moment ' s pause , added , " my eldest sister has been in town these three months 	4.010487193155819
but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue , she could easily conjecture 	3.417404577102312
and then , what do you think we did ? we dressed up chamberlayne in woman ' s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun ! not a soul knew of it , but col 	3.452164140572319
it was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor 	3.959078682512693
" then , " observed elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman 	3.974427522271441
" " you judge very properly , " said mr bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy 	4.1074763059919155
that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer 	4.259975828951214
" a place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected 	3.6426965831315847
my good opinion once lost is lost for ever 	2.9253626643098354
but as he took up his abode with the lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet 	3.222066831858879
it is because he will not give himself the trouble 	4.003601059965794
<num>	3.986380516691557
she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards 	3.6544686954870285
but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited 	4.001592674581471
the wish of procuring her regard , which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire , could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this 	3.984350214941898
in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london 	3.83349359973076
and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire 	3.5670129589194253
" how could i ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in her face 	3.9436457829737326
" and this is always the way with him , " she added 	3.988065842637293
i thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town 	3.6942220866712048
" lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue 	3.793357820488528
" i often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ' s friends 	3.8918547833215418
" " but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? " " you must decide for yourself , " said elizabeth , " and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by all means to refuse him 	3.5996515311800548
but we are all liable to error 	3.45543379697458
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield 	4.512409987278559
" and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter 	3.639644023272055
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity 	3.691630479688176
for to her inexpressible vexation , she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy , who sat opposite to them 	4.044474872168297
" the tumult of elizabeth ' s mind was allayed by this conversation 	4.097134368631086
she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself 	4.295790162634862
and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense 	3.8519917891873843
and considering mr collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state 	3.3694535873496707
but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew 	4.221425714145077
you know my mother ' s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends 	4.234719205720287
" " oh ! no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both 	3.0772361039541796
if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one 	3.8776476998658547
ring the bell , kitty , for hill 	4.550790672652659
he was then , he said , on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her 	4.063028243144688
if it must be so , it must 	4.41240731286323
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room 	4.09713886082823
" darcy only smiled 	4.038394277623731
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford 	3.965999446291908
you could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine 	3.7100252575162385
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do 	4.223549904524919
she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " there are very few people of whom so much can be said 	4.002359059614816
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her 	3.9950522563683974
in which case you may be sure of my pardon 	4.042609631098326
the one missent must be first attended to 	4.14625913188492
though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy 	3.5727809254887712
the compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt 	4.870030046060786
a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is 	4.625733881027207
but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable 	3.7943727145858555
lizzy is not a bit better than the others 	4.0973611553267855
it is from my cousin , mr collins , who , when i am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases 	3.9476848687755783
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object 	3.4147141635181533
as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth 	3.5002873822276617
" your examination of mr darcy is over , i presume , " said miss bingley 	4.254867793507907
" " that will make your ladyship ' s situation at present more pitiable 	3.924107154355634
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening 	3.160706505467873
make haste , and come down this moment 	3.5832087361962754
" " mr collins moreover adds , " " i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia ' s sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known 	3.7371352967185105
mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display 	3.8260117085099714
for though they could not all talk , they could all eat 	4.107635485046623
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view 	3.3710188017176126
i shall see her in january 	4.20901018432115
" but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery 	4.007898154688279
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly 	4.377753131362627
they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon maria 	3.5897697635156045
" " these are heavy misfortunes , " replied elizabeth 	3.4607924519712028
" " yes , and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise 	3.3396740880832656
" " yes , madam , " said mrs bennet , delighted to speak to a lady catherine 	3.610031226924684
he now seated himself by her , and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire , of travelling and staying at home , of new books and music , that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before 	3.2890546630041784
" mrs hill began instantly to express her joy 	3.5428811553636725
pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned 	4.065466944353474
" chapter xiii 	2.7454326203140167
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did 	3.3808858360538396
the present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary 	4.231077807699362
" elizabeth asked questions in vain 	3.5121085251833977
" elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness 	3.1783739213211324
" " not as you represent it 	3.443045789616976
but of all the views which his garden , or which the country , or the kingdom could boast , none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings , afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house 	3.5695790360578843
but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to mr darcy 	4.2640343597466535
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence 	3.5528218361761437
" " i should be sorry indeed , if it were 	3.5042930195664956
though i am sure ( and i do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole 	4.016317685497033
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " it is your turn to say something now , mr darcy 	3.6817727274730547
told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her ' s , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry 	5.153247504495333
but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit 	3.8636578381177933
can you , yourself , lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? " " not perhaps of neglecting his own interest 	4.2012158185696205
and sir william , to elizabeth ' s high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way 	4.99760770084144
she was shewn into the breakfast parlour , where all but jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise 	3.5309080449352677
good heaven ! brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of meryton 	4.410442531374447
and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page 	3.918930723396603
i should say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has several 	4.374607828414862
and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr darcy ' s civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister 	3.677388279927926
as they passed through the hall , lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on 	3.820974975615194
excuse me for i must speak plainly 	4.99176606592757
she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself 	3.4479396739338224
mrs reynolds could interest her on no other point 	3.5191299175357402
it is unaccountable ! in every view it is unaccountable ! " " my dear lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these 	3.32953279449511
bingley of course returned with him to dinner 	4.542162467740124
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh , i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters 	3.7264728688549416
and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange 	4.17738619993992
and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to 	3.759038037032803
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself 	3.4392931508425657
it was kindly meant 	4.092141930296034
my temper i dare not vouch for 	4.636734880158792
when they parted , lady catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year 	3.4947232753988406
you alluded to something else 	4.125793193702613
you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these 	3.760543139217405
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley , and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well 	3.363821650537772
ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it 	4.253145007420555
and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding 	4.320548395610792
you shall hear what she says 	3.7718670123844396
we were married , you know , at st 	4.229690199946981
" but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands 	3.971248578824597
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her 	3.614491903995885
i thought him very sly 	4.165926414618383
to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected 	4.825213166266594
come as soon as you can on the receipt of this 	4.915375365894901
his former acquaintance had been numerous 	4.681118076147472
" mrs collins , you must send a servant with them 	4.395131209435742
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way 	3.3222680712520516
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell , but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you 	3.882565537934783
your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why i come 	3.5331568547999845
i thought i should have broke my heart 	4.083585202290664
" " perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson 	3.055414220848213
" your friend performs delightfully 	3.9026586322997368
you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude 	3.816841051765108
his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had 	3.7093794820105237
" from herself to jane from jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcy ' s explanation there , had appeared very insufficient 	3.611050535117202
jane resolutely kept her place at the table 	3.8885966764661126
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? " " oh , yes ! you will only think i feel more than i ought to do , when i tell you all 	3.9434538077748043
people did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas 	3.727629698971488
" " that is very true , " said elizabeth 	2.5027492981998316
that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately 	3.433941932428853
she received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice 	3.891991936565126
" " but does lydia know nothing of this ? can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand ? " " oh , yes ! that , that is the worst of all 	3.4949244861815916
hopeless of seeing him before 	5.48034742566905
let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers 	4.312898318176685
" i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that 	3.541497663728528
every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable 	4.288571713495777
and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men 	3.0631380801847126
mr collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many 	2.9987525362654073
the copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work 	3.8287513902507575
" " the person of whom i speak , is a gentleman and a stranger 	3.686215208927742
a most delightful place ! excellent parsonage house ! it would have suited me in every respect 	3.569731811678692
my excellent father died about five years ago 	3.7585286042460333
follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do divert me , i own , and i laugh at them whenever i can 	5.234112549486196
and soon afterwards mr darcy , drawing near elizabeth , said to her " do not you feel a great inclination , miss bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? " she smiled , but made no answer 	3.926047514632563
" " you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which i have never acknowledged 	3.448743894817178
from the entrance hall , of which mr collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti chamber , to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and mrs jenkinson were sitting 	4.36311354878428
charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility 	3.8045424338495697
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of 	3.5547009694315106
elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply 	4.234090755550166
elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from pemberley 	3.748751738803576
nay , when i read a letter of his , i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law 	4.082120570733404
how thankful am i , that we never let them know what has been said against him 	3.8287252556182714
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within 	4.0103905290701265
his style was not penitent , but haughty 	5.670813958472379
but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone 	3.9432252249048925
till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea 	3.8651091211962814
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield 	3.5123477540151025
mrs collins , did i tell you of lady metcalfe ' s calling yesterday to thank me ? she finds miss pope a treasure 	3.739936175193925
" " i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it 	3.43313749267874
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? she supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter 	3.742412860058693
he cannot afford it 	4.118530543624522
console lady catherine as well as you can 	5.738498504629235
and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world , he was caught by their easy playfulness 	4.401180668116869
she repented , though she hardly knew of what 	4.893774247736745
and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable 	3.5136823113171918
why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? " " why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear 	3.9432788300514874
the moment of her release from him was ecstacy 	5.221656917546637
" " i can much more easily believe mr bingley ' s being imposed on , than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night 	3.47215369093106
" elizabeth made no answer 	2.318513523547789
and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball 	3.5159640550777915
but she does not know , no one can know how much i suffer from what she says 	3.7596998529837493
" " i would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried bingley , " for a kingdom ! upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as i have this evening 	3.9155570674711875
but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly 	3.8910811973951818
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant 	4.428077311918089
and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself 	4.2615130126209015
they attacked him in various ways 	4.158117861632978
i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance 	3.0049303657586197
" " i must not decide on my own performance 	3.3259804152126873
and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn , they would be going there for ever 	3.4549134523861618
" elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart 	3.525859362893635
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use 	3.4257961827610703
at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , " mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain 	3.889475284400036
but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply 	3.820572077405153
they have at least that advantage 	4.01465234679001
in truth i must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings 	3.9803882872657614
i cannot blame myself for having done thus much 	3.528139542466166
and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left meryton greatly in debt 	4.236994143233043
in such an exigence my uncle ' s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world 	3.643326126590735
his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad 	4.244370360258573
to this speech bingley made no answer 	3.1079268306171013
" " this is not to be borne 	3.8351140087664395
lady catherine ' s great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of 	3.9715222497442326
" " if it is designedly done , they cannot be justified 	3.750026324817953
the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits 	4.944775939671487
" but jane could think with certainty on only one point , that mr bingley , if he had _ imposed on , would have much to suffer when the affair became public 	3.647091567441206
one came from her books , and the other from her toilette 	4.747133730836305
she retreated from the window , fearful of being seen 	4.124144633404577
" why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? " she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure 	3.837357206128501
<num>	3.986380516691557
" " i assure you , madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advice 	3.645899455671984
" " you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said mr darcy , looking at the eldest miss bennet 	3.907944778523308
i must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married 	4.22848045556963
and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her party 	3.9458860699427127
" on miss lucas ' s persevering , however , she added , " very well 	4.335679340363061
" pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried colonel fitzwilliam 	4.113055107323336
and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate 	3.6699296966853425
" safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune 	4.084022830062737
at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and i spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer 	3.7448313805421916
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered 	3.842792065491429
that is all to be forgot 	4.166750582982845
much as i respect them , i believe , i thought only of you 	4.744882942828363
" mr bennet ' s expectations were fully answered 	3.6157812074273785
and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to every thing ? impossible 	3.242302323961855
but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley 	3.9959717931905443
her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world ! how strange must it appear to him ! in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! oh ! why did she come ? or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage 	3.4282758868414756
she could not but say , after a moment ' s deliberation , " i am not 	4.2302042792171095
let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied 	3.733946033200083
elizabeth immediately began playing again 	3.797202007042254
but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room 	4.146079944590347
i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you 	4.812999529258006
her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine ' s curiosity 	3.4519561664582565
his character sunk on every review of it 	2.941816863063013
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn 	3.327932323956219
she really looked almost wild 	4.256071097479639
this is my advice 	4.176507101849156
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us 	3.497726003970863
" " she is a very good kind of girl , i believe 	3.367343494639518
i cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done 	3.546466359673565
she was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one ' s approach 	4.19624609931184
she had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ' s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance 	4.080426215057006
" what will be his surprise , " thought she , " when he knows who they are ! he takes them now for people of fashion 	3.362130359114143
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her 	4.549367154403255
mr darcy replied with great intrepidity , " miss elizabeth bennet 	5.064134850840952
and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged 	3.5076622574794394
and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart 	4.041499244033872
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one 	3.437239300241893
it was the favourite wish of his mother , as well as of her ' s 	3.7007176692327985
it was really a very handsome thought 	4.1766467488631065
mr darcy walked off 	4.23511619755954
on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another 	4.013677833600066
all elizabeth ' s anger against him had been long done away 	4.322538299836257
by nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at st 	3.0183709934817156
and even jane , who believed still less of it , became almost hopeless , more especially as the time was now come , when if they had gone to scotland , which she had never before entirely despaired of , they must in all probability have gained some news of them 	3.7005998647419163
the old lady is mrs jenkinson , who lives with them 	3.5589197335415768
but charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty 	4.784575968841828

" " can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? " " yes 	3.1452760089141134
you have sense , and we all expect you to use it 	4.019081883043751
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache 	3.628508188247443
" to catherine and lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting 	3.4324407858192294
jane was distressed 	3.9906123639582782
but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal 	3.117326203962449
their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! let me never see either one or the other again ! " yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover 	3.4251984274640357
its banks were neither formal , nor falsely adorned 	3.608111622856442
" it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane , " said she 	4.006210346138833
they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt 	3.6365782930602357
i knew how it would be 	3.8822214487288558
pray , how violent _ mr bingley ' s love ? " " i never saw a more promising inclination 	4.047881140728217
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her 	3.338879666205821
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur 	3.558574546507855
but when they had withdrawn , he said to her , " mrs bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding 	3.9875489712196273
and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance 	4.199270214640173
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money 	3.8036251744714638
and as soon as they were in the parlour , he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode , and punctually repeated all his wife ' s offers of refreshment 	3.294785953270886
and from this time mr bingley ' s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them 	3.6003704594171286
" how good it was in you , my dear mr bennet ! but i knew i should persuade you at last 	4.031678571913786
her mother ' s ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth ' s mind 	3.327987528747332
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself 	5.033104082779456
i do not know of any other designs that he had formed : but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this 	4.092216284573881
and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like any thing 	4.273371846218744
" " do let us have a little music , " cried miss bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share 	4.240597146322793
and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes 	3.6350611065351743
" not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs bennet give up the point 	3.8335549178938177
both sisters were uncomfortable enough 	4.226861628483868
and wickham had constant admission to the house 	4.670552202884637
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned 	3.432519390385933
" bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business 	3.8247172685892807
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters 	3.6781890822153307
that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself 	4.4259492196738055
there are few people in england , i suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste 	3.376450944376876
but there was still something lurking behind , of which prudence forbad the disclosure 	3.8518189337373303
mr gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject 	3.317349573543014
" but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only 	3.369325061788831
" the boy protested that she should not 	3.5895106609687897
" but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley ' s salutation 	4.140352763812417
" i am sorry to hear that 	3.543263774317527
it is too long ago 	3.91989307643469
it is done , however , and it was done for the best 	4.582227435249128
jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them 	3.485073061074873
" " oh ! your father of course may spare you , if your mother can 	3.2952266436682405
at least , therefore , i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies 	3.5740494811630072
they had , therefore , many acquaintance in common 	4.38862744047402
" what could become of mr bingley and jane ! " was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs 	3.6187946177402304
" " no , indeed , i did not 	3.768581062228059
oh ! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance ! " " oh ! my dear , " continued mrs bennet , " i am quite delighted with him 	4.224309688787868
" i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places 	3.505353237245261
and then we were so merry all the way home ! we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! " to this , mary very gravely replied , " far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures 	3.50872120749666
i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten 	4.552129248388035
your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter 	4.061795009033768
they will take care not to outrun their income 	3.706609738968122
'lady catherine ,' said she , 'you have given me a treasure 	4.5668630499789025
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family 	3.3617424248308265
" her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation 	3.321998561670164
" did it , " said he , " did it soon make you think better of me ? did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? " she explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed 	3.7392750350335735
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children 	3.913288529725854
no wonder if they love her better 	3.9025824949023864
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage 	4.350413580890023
for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution 	4.347492746023886
" " i say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , " replied the other 	4.027777924992132
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy 	3.801631738336389
" " yes , she did 	3.6723794301658153
but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object 	4.009467951011165
" with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew 	3.448827826447037
and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away 	3.5749978481866274
" shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? " " i can answer your question , " said fitzwilliam , " without applying to him 	3.623533029388186
" elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room 	3.2074447997048203
my mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! " " oh ! jane , " cried elizabeth , " was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? " " i do not know 	4.281770143337104
the hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object 	4.09972152337051
but to say the truth , i was too cross to write 	4.331600111108529
she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times 	3.582289140788472
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited 	3.1582861135446785
" " if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it 	3.341500672001674
and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then 	4.115619263650099
" " upon my word , sir , " cried elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration 	3.2335703754803062
its business office is located at <num> north <num> west , salt lake city , ut <num>, ( <num> ) <num> <num>	4.13296381823251
mrs bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected 	3.736970419606913
and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys 	4.142247699750304
i do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , jane one does not often see any body better looking 	3.5209010140017125
he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business 	4.159144562430389
but there were other causes of repugnance 	3.87587005875724
" mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it 	3.889799906234337
" " already arisen ! " repeated mr bennet 	3.8765113180945265
this match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place 	4.64357340077162
" my dearest lizzy will , i am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley ' s regard for me 	3.8577695231469855
they were of a respectable family in the north of england 	3.2147820171608847
" " and i have another favour to ask 	3.4645824078074905
his appearance was greatly in his favour 	4.297343258262547
he was angry 	4.447672179676982
a house in town ! every thing that is charming ! three daughters married ! ten thousand a year ! oh , lord ! what will become of me 	3.3554948826442264
mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once 	4.000652672415182
but , lizzy ! oh , sister ! it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collins ' s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness 	3.8481961948274512
i think not 	4.6624086302272625
and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement 	3.715879355691646
but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded 	4.073076790085046
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence , strict liability , breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph <num>	4.170080536734263
" well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy 	3.2922465960674945
to be sure london was rather thin , but however the little theatre was open 	3.5290843090914437
are sufficiently known 	4.986946242512316
and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion 	4.0938793003456295
at present , however , i consider myself as quite fixed here 	4.115404173661907
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased 	3.264320888443101
thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together 	4.303391241769606
and he might imagine , from my father ' s behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that he would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter 	4.195015801525131
i have not an instant to lose 	3.849992563795705
will you hear it ? " " most willingly 	4.8438358653774385
pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it 	4.018922138174707
she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement 	4.037847853104535
he is so excessively handsome ! and his sisters are charming women 	3.804676472031114
and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned 	3.8227514786357832
and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! it would be such a delicious scheme , and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all 	3.9032826805644523
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman 	4.083148637859541
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse 	4.101905522088184
every thing nourishes what is strong already 	3.9362683049957043
your sister i also watched 	4.439224752264833
" oh ! yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well , and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again 	3.556899253435563
but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved 	3.53246625308007
my feelings in every respect forbid it 	3.8223924016734325
he has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister 	3.8048482740703475
this unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day 	3.8720107867524756
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper 	3.929361375122546
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end 	3.6981576957695994
what congratulations will then flow in ! i appeal to mr darcy : but let me not interrupt you , sir 	3.854673024779949
he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address 	3.666256032814953

it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge 	3.643610461892479
the gentlemen arrived early 	4.030202775660407
and when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether 	3.5504448246949187
and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , 'she a beauty ! i should as soon call her mother a wit 	3.5232919022637477
jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears 	3.774948480511229

i wonder when you would have spoken , if i had not asked you ! my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect 	3.4965777780961287
mr collins made his declaration in form 	3.566442559106109
james ' s , sir william was so completely awed , by the grandeur surrounding him , that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow , and take his seat without saying a word 	4.1392034964094355

but , alas ! the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair 	3.994393013249556
she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down 	4.384587122747399
more thoughtfulness , and less anxiety to please than when they last met , were plainly expressed 	4.348300482709837
he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected 	4.044635242420812

let her go then 	4.904372127392007
but she was satisfied with none 	3.85384033818828
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited 	4.350798679728285

i never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong 	3.525808649642513

and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love 	3.765118458063928
" he has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! i had not believed it possible 	4.044862566544707
i 	5.149475509988577
he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things 	4.43512408769773
<num>	3.986380516691557
elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude 	3.3655631875499927
the next morning , however , made an alteration 	4.574641100293112
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards , she could not be wanted to counteract her mother ' s schemes 	4.5182854276186655
elizabeth was excessively disappointed 	3.5705507999240957
mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character 	3.6036103166198576
she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall i call it ? susceptibility to her feelings 	3.9161153495262466
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light 	4.43256091557809

" but what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? " " a thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy 	3.7426331514051494
and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us 	3.731192448510087
i depend on you for that 	4.499119163671695
and lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world 	3.519156029559534
" " i am not likely to leave kent for some time 	3.2201687429101375

but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien 	3.226706144892506
let me mend it for you 	3.7161236023251147
mrs philips ' s vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance 	4.200019091086343
but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well 	3.347048892023994
" i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town 	3.389232156173075
reflection must be reserved for solitary hours 	4.229745357326686
you shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness 	3.3996134331948786
the apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it 	4.174995978150667
" * * * * * the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great 	3.4597194719645787
and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance 	3.775687912125445
charlotte herself was tolerably composed 	4.185590947009541
if he had _ motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him 	3.806039618975754
and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr bingley , was incomprehensible 	4.50653552979359
such formidable accounts of her ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened maria lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at st 	3.6439007793472076
" " i have heard much of your master ' s fine person , " said mrs gardiner , looking at the picture 	3.5702039018062615
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me 	4.109676428355916
her uncle and aunt were all amazement 	3.4498893498349377
but it pleased her 	4.2263815252714805
i cannot misunderstand you , but i intreat you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that _ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk 	4.013293544585324
thank heaven ! i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him 	3.564443022259842
i talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples 	4.215557746970059
chapter vi 	3.8875837814206093
he was very fond of them 	3.9185726941337204
" i hope , my dear , " said mr bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to day , because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party 	4.059831737794141
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them 	4.146675512112225
it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh ' s family 	3.1912713765270615
seriously , i would have you be on your guard 	4.867774859879913
mr darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart 	3.8894503615777243
" " and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , " added kitty 	2.9641697092821024
in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society 	4.092951949776562
" the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news , and telling again what had been already written 	3.1956912816255323
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him 	3.5939201142139487

i congratulate her 	5.285470548662405
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered 	4.2160199062145445
at night she opened her heart to jane 	4.114986580709515
his sisters declared that they were miserable 	4.418003038834442
mr gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation 	3.739417613408283
colonel fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman 	3.3467366233238436
after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , " is not this nice ? is not this an agreeable surprise ? " " and we mean to treat you all , " added lydia 	3.6235262550871634
both changed colour , one looked white , the other red 	3.7068833261281333
if he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go 	3.808583749512867
that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son 	3.58089695715053
elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification 	4.291884867338311
and tell my dear lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses 	3.8831065871300967
one i will not mention 	5.923919572928861
chapter x 	2.9674598914339794
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure 	3.7732384357393016
she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more 	3.9987394032988512
but i have always observed , that they who are good natured when children , are good natured when they grow up 	3.3378508751997074
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan 	3.8322472581771576
miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place 	3.726174634681542
" " and do you really know all this ? " cried mrs gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive 	3.4576085741358953
elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself 	3.2663862089963187
" " aye that is because you have the right disposition 	3.6260229778201287
the subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away 	4.207556104312194
it is very unlucky 	3.746764619112241
we were always good friends 	4.127979656489129
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it 	3.3897697227838726
but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane ' s letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you , can give you no fresh pain 	3.896854262029236
but not long was the interval of tranquillity 	3.6408760894059644
the younger girls formed hopes of coming _ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done 	3.167818817147187
from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him 	3.865280232306395
eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress 	3.5811929754171596
mamma would like to go too of all things ! only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! " " yes , " thought elizabeth , " that would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once 	3.7257340563007917
its solace was visiting and news 	3.8931606186697145
and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell , the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard 	4.195716880272812
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth ' s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty 	3.682236209077892
you blamed me for coming ? " " no indeed 	5.03793793963403
she had seen enough of bingley ' s behaviour to jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last 	4.729906199597791
" he replied , " and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled 	4.039269388155098
though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character 	3.418657418106185
" " perfectly so i thank you 	3.5506577334696194
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette 	3.257467582756025
and who knows what may happen ? but that is nothing to us 	3.9043813619909864
" do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain 	3.4752449048165786
" " i can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me 	3.3677532321288512
from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink 	5.45047433553754
for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her 	3.5347607602751507
" he is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively 	3.6228213367686535

and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr bennet were dead 	3.851133274997671
and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance 	3.4031939185894546
" " this is the consequence you see , madam , of marrying a daughter , " said elizabeth 	3.498311874640664
and sleeping one night on the road , reached longbourn by dinner time the next day 	3.5425731685287647
it was all over before i arrived 	3.5852407695460173
" he is as fine a fellow , " said mr bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever i saw 	3.932948738926652
a fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly very little 	4.089278433987651
mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips 	3.161004789304315
but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy 	3.7792000401286363
he is come mr bingley is come 	4.205410521123596
after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains 	3.51072366116933
when they were all in the drawing room , the questions which elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give 	3.7654303952453825
and miss darcy is always down for the summer months 	3.6649917735327042
" " as often as i can 	4.205004850336099
it is of all subjects my delight 	3.7671499412283413
but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic 	3.5384301230810142
" " i certainly shall not 	3.462346398977719
elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight 	3.5539846531270336
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing ' s park , when he put his letter into her hand ! she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it 	3.490226189115237
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding 	4.0204173028114045
there was no arguing upon such a project 	3.4685591514746155
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? " elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment 	3.3700202998559834
mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets 	3.4571878781418857
he has more to give 	4.141593775073186
oh ! had i known what i ought , what i dared , to do ! but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much 	3.736495831805332
and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers 	3.4569081776901474
not that i care about it , though 	4.3708140957527215
" mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments 	3.168866281027679
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceived again 	3.730093461495954
no one was to be put in competition with him 	3.9563931599091515
the supposition did not pain her 	4.071679276070764
after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball 	3.743646863712316
" " no , " said colonel fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me 	3.836023095987661
when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music 	3.907777495327014
we live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her 	3.838805061910249
jane was not happy 	3.664640981871804
" what could he mean ? she was dying to know what could be his meaning " and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ? " not at all , " was her answer 	3.6160335691575196
that such a consequence as this should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts 	4.030280120057393
" " i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do 	3.13371725091283
" " nay , if you are so serious about it , i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled 	4.64854316197739
yes , there was something in that 	5.238154823963611
for , of course , they were to have a son 	5.107489641396847
at length , every idea seemed to fail him 	3.343244202969517
and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification 	3.475945371489234
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from lady catherine 	3.624423477149265
" " pride , " observed mary , who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections , " is a very common failing i believe 	4.61365889318203
" we have dined nine times at rosings , besides drinking tea there twice ! how much i shall have to tell ! " elizabeth privately added , " and how much i shall have to conceal 	3.5027410298848265
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense 	3.7097556942424132
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas 	4.181885796076196
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband 	3.398813354314237
" jane shook her head 	3.2781811809774335
soon after you left me on saturday , i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were 	3.8934510685527726
" " i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , " he coldly replied 	3.3857740206000493
" " and have you heard from him often ? " " we have heard only once 	3.630695184715137
and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure 	3.9377044595865334
and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close 	3.2910593142334323
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when i write to them , and sign my name lydia wickham 	4.231810218549962
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was 	3.024520693251413
and now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be 	3.8000921071342106
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family 	3.659088205245473
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence 	3.287676070067432
mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride 	3.721680253528553
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge 	4.0747880512083166
" as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind 	3.4125665070329534
but it is of small importance 	3.5417797882092565
in anticipating the happiness of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house 	3.7561708424778715
" you quite mistook mr darcy 	4.253126043124523
while there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him 	4.314056869439643
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation 	3.213788178666067
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained 	3.688812504174508
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth 	3.426760966154494
but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future 	3.5574936318783887
" and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident 	3.5137698383620375
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible 	3.5041995323983133
it was an animating subject , and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match 	2.974116067674612
he immediately offered to fetch her others 	3.8853370933204276
bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn 	3.905588529183937
" " that would be a good scheme , " said elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home 	3.5980619190797536
colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief 	3.443482562152333
miss darcy , the daughter of mr darcy , of pemberley , and lady anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner 	4.295741621897978
there is nothing in that 	3.9553287410179854
he enquired in a friendly , though general way , after her family , and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done 	4.072646724288456
these were the contents : " my dear harriet , " you will laugh when you know where i am gone , and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning , as soon as i am missed 	4.2424046708662635
" i confess , " said he , " that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship ' s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings 	3.595104480768528
" " upon my word , caroline , i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation 	3.0018331710944417
with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family 	4.675582958617754
but , however , do not speak to mr darcy about it , if you had rather not 	4.878756584530359
elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives 	3.7226228854705448
i was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him 	4.369952139617544
" but , my dear elizabeth , " she added , " what sort of girl is miss king ? i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary 	3.5386375148583666
" but i am sure it will be too much for kitty 	4.392431321259387

" " that is exactly what i should have supposed of you , " said elizabeth 	3.052012394590397
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them 	3.859986194936957
but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good 	3.887330016786199
mr collins must excuse me 	3.9920629455546273
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty 	3.3500035116705584
and in farther justification of mr darcy , she could not but allow that mr bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair 	4.334952595464544
he must write his own sermons 	4.258793533866862
there was too much to be thought 	4.890877982114856
i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere 	3.8976678729151524
" well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual 	3.4915647072035045
for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton , these visitors came 	3.6448259064092787
bingley met them with hopes that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected 	3.5738521032261015
but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " engaged to mr collins ! my dear charlotte , impossible ! " the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach 	3.7005414305562043
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention 	3.646489498938767
chapter xvi 	3.5396357525995215
you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her 	3.967574444904114
they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence 	3.4297249579836713
mr darcy said very little , and mr hurst nothing at all 	4.039366096721444
with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage 	3.833229328724132
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name 	4.405244606002375
and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight 	3.8220767722057727
elizabeth soon heard from her friend 	3.8431008200014114
are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? " " no really , " replied elizabeth 	4.370548102356186
but with the rich , he is liberal minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure 	3.2440139080294403
james ' s 	3.3928607133246973
nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural 	4.108985963452949
in that case he would return no more 	3.8212640624992353
one has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it 	4.074739241149006
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world 	4.083927782509108
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of mr collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings 	4.189477974535378
and when i next write to her , i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account 	4.185999825572821
i hope at least he has not deceived us 	3.4967986583646784
her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it 	5.3085414463318745
lord ! how i should like to be married before any of you 	4.099768320836814
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock 	3.2440543034046323
" " ah ! " cried mrs bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls 	3.5182095588621745
however , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and i am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves 	3.7427386242041667
" they are going to be encamped near brighton 	4.448352772219603
but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent 	3.164089290143798
they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either 	4.112250439767492
i am perfectly serious in my refusal 	3.649023119330167
every sister except mary agreed to go with her 	3.5409960959079116
and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor 	4.218184465696651
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in 	3.9302330274797392
" " i dislike it very much , " he replied 	3.930713439005598
i am most seriously displeased 	4.009782312340686
you wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if i speak ill of any body 	3.9930887599931286
for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father ' s will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions 	3.9443980704794392
he is a most interesting young man 	3.7585761639632462
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way 	3.970715265385577
and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls 	3.6258507819463737
" you want to tell me , and i have no objection to hearing it 	4.289271706049503
<num>	3.986380516691557
it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want 	3.420135233338045
but he soon afterwards said , " i was surprised to see darcy in town last month 	3.583980676707879
" it is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , " continued her mother , " but at the same time , mr bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me 	3.924351242914962
the consequence of it is , that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have , and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever 	4.385003258154629
" " are you quite sure , ma'am ? is not there a little mistake ? " said jane 	3.1008340147880564
but intricate characters are the most amusing 	3.681445004993311
his sisters were fine women , with an air of decided fashion 	3.268967023409001
" to jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection 	4.467447844497886
and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene 	3.6418061636135453
with such rivals for the notice of the fair , as mr wickham and the officers , mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance 	4.3818506936717
and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once 	3.058647185246707
and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william ' s in his regimentals 	3.180729499705117
" " why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks 	3.6264942084469305
" " that you certainly shall 	3.7756961365083597
where else can they be so well concealed ? " " and lydia used to want to go to london , " added kitty 	3.9174752278180667
and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office 	4.16466740949186
and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation , though it was only on its being a wet night , and on the probability of a rainy season , made her feel that the commonest , dullest , most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker 	3.8720335510875303
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure 	3.7942373488174166
when the ladies were separating for the toilette , he said to elizabeth , " do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel 	3.8440242527129853
" he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself 	3.841315516347703
" elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded 	3.1015921391717027
i send no compliments to your mother 	4.120691441615662
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine 	3.281614783756253
every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room 	4.038321774823966
her many attractions were again dwelt on , and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter 	4.1731190710200075
" " pardon me for interrupting you , madam , " cried mr collins 	3.9051930584345884
his sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile 	3.968712713759937
but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it 	4.356189147505898
besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the shire have left meryton , and they are going in a fortnight 	4.541404821645516
and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning 	3.9911082984673953
elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea 	3.71560720212694
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all 	3.4526193307507285
she has two nieces of her own 	4.156974022956664
you must contrive to send somebody 	4.057636644150548
his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do 	3.394476443914163
but will they make you happy ? " " have you any other objection , " said elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? " " none at all 	3.9026565027163653
i believe i have now told you every thing 	3.737983961520591
which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend 	3.5842442767888545
she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so 	3.797018823747196
they were , therefore , to go 	4.466001132802466
for while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on any one else 	3.7719415519502633
his accompanying them was a double advantage 	4.398074197201233
but mrs bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday , which would exactly finish jane ' s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before 	3.7176173937039834
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible 	3.5895306979644386
whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish 	3.8014192797691457
she could not bear such suspense 	3.7902077711062114
" this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret 	2.712861493256638

" now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy 	3.780886347134147
i know your disposition , lizzy 	3.9700717026601158
he knows where we live 	4.1261720920637535
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage 	3.7698323164859304
" " then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce mr bingley to her 	4.314739909424457
and then you must stay all night 	3.267867969258733
but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme 	3.4588921309104554
" i cannot make him out 	4.2332911279152015
" he is the best landlord , and the best master , " said she , " that ever lived 	4.446385395838692
i think i have heard you say that you know them 	3.354218092716495
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re establish a character 	3.3466973101995827
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense 	4.231285043760663
" 'tis too much ! " she added , " by far too much 	4.248564711762045
not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it 	3.664336634596214
information about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the project gutenberg literary archive foundation is a non profit <num>( c )( <num> ) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the internal revenue service 	3.6612116150920664
they have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression 	3.5357554753893683
she then joined them soon enough to see lydia , with anxious parade , walk up to her mother ' s right hand , and hear her say to her eldest sister , " ah ! jane , i take your place now , and you must go lower , because i am a married woman 	3.8230478280878506
and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once 	4.132834751311738
" she is my youngest girl but one 	3.6610120171310507
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing 	4.23654251970588
but it is to the credit of his modesty 	3.8225329961754775
and that being the case , i cannot consider your situation with much compassion 	3.950842136243414
he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners 	3.70230771734201
from what he said of miss darcy , i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl 	4.0933731394362
" " dining out , " said mrs bennet , " that is very unlucky 	3.99444270015378
but now several minutes elapsed , without bringing the sound of his voice 	3.778785472312063
" " but , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him 	4.0142764427877795
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand 	3.3398299730191376
" " that is to say , you had given your permission 	4.004603857995473
lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy 	3.5471671874370876
one seems so forlorn without them 	4.1514402555070475
your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice 	4.16217270099504
she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it 	4.08102658376761
intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done 	4.622936252037546
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner 	4.089567393642012
do not you , darcy ? " " my style of writing is very different from yours 	4.069994408803273
he promises fairly , and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent 	3.904594631630028
and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend 	3.5528971835898067
i was very uncomfortable , i may say unhappy 	4.124524344859488
but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another _ in the affair 	3.6538851920394646
lady catherine might see him in her way through town 	3.984749402435239
the pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men 	3.5838100846529195
but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw mr darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister 	3.9996447633755547
but as she reached the door , it was opened by a servant , and mr darcy appeared 	4.40074942935337
for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil 	4.061161459816446
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments 	3.4428170709327257
" " certainly not 	3.772830457115691
the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter 	4.530905577020448
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter 	3.646464250209012

there could not exist in the world two men , over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influence 	4.515487666068208
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence 	3.8185405859123907
i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point 	3.148653849226166
she had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years 	3.353558225112477
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good naturedly engaged mr collins ' s conversation to herself 	3.9641953320644263
that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ' s indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ! ) to put me on my guard ? can there be any other opinion on the subject ? " " yes , there can 	4.004218032235136
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea 	3.8210997394243713
<num>	3.986380516691557
" " and they must marry ! yet he is such a man ! " " yes , yes , they must marry 	3.89863959789164
but , my dearest jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend 	3.554897411121013
" i assure you , i feel it exceedingly , " said lady catherine 	4.0055907447193135
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information , was as sincere as her brother ' s in sending it 	3.6148985030254512
poor jane ! i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately 	4.29608800733732
and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour 	4.032781514187135
<num>	3.986380516691557
" the picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed rooms , were all that remained to be shewn 	3.289046441442371
i know it cannot be long 	4.257499495272728
we must not all expect jane ' s good fortune 	4.286629219442029
which are naturally lively enough 	4.273827118907603
" " exceed their income ! my dear mr bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you talking of ? why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more 	3.374183037787508
" and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit 	3.3097123737160383
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance 	3.224494000651292
she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge 	4.034463160729758
and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments 	3.6521088544173206
" " it is from miss bingley , " said jane , and then read it aloud 	4.409603704934766
you know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it 	3.3116289184922234
" this was not very consoling to mrs bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate 	4.67643319961928
now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits 	4.027180575920085
" mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication 	3.2969095583657637
" she could think of nothing more to say 	3.348380569716219
the garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving 	5.019014368805229
when mr bennet arrived , he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure 	3.8938456260034844
with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning 	3.293169613985167
but , recovering herself , said in a lively tone , " and pray , what is the usual price of an earl ' s younger son ? unless the elder brother is very sickly , i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds 	3.7610493273405328
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home , and see if i can make it up any better 	4.031836772028105
i have told miss bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more 	3.9560216136376076
" my dear mr bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that netherfield park is let at last ? " mr bennet replied that he had not 	3.804806143303666
" this was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas 	3.1262069442146654
mr collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give 	3.199617890963149
" i never heard any thing so abominable 	3.378688079279772
they are gone off together from brighton 	3.602837255010867
it will not do 	4.322381411733846
we want none of them 	4.12769859175567
" " and yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them 	3.47850448043554
that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him 	3.7743205250917127
" elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment 	3.2919131725592656
" " that is his notion of christian forgiveness ! the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte ' s situation , and his expectation of a young olive branch 	4.161114180536349
" what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia ! " she cried 	3.400510876483679
" this will not do , " said elizabeth 	4.108751978934834
while sir william was with them , mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig , and shewing him the country 	5.207787529036705
" again his astonishment was obvious 	4.218748241699799
and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself 	3.936237892711268
" " yes , indeed 	3.021613959078807
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage , it was more difficult to understand 	3.9454303214102864
so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great 	3.498475392736382
" " that is a failing indeed ! " cried elizabeth 	3.070837376638091
mr darcy , you cannot deny the fact 	4.653478136709651
and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them 	3.525387452198411
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical 	4.488554057401658
and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known any thing of the matter 	3.4083117826386973
not that i mean to find fault with you , for such things i know are all chance in this world 	3.537368683730156
" " mr darcy ! " repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement 	3.696543635242258
" miss bennet still looked all amazement 	3.5836534155176225
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved 	4.523215750097439
elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together 	4.111148905323806
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent 	3.1907552933723333
but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt 	4.35971301475497
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? " " will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? " " by all means , " cried bingley 	3.6877154174006743
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever 	3.2840370398804737
" " but why all this secrecy ? why any fear of detection ? why must their marriage be private ? oh ! no , no , this is not likely 	3.19536382811395
" " we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes , " said her mother resentfully , " since we are not to visit 	4.462369317423789
balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters 	3.869964347254942
i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure 	3.0984862089676706
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far 	4.209562743013611
" " oh , yes 	2.9268056218414924
she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could , provided he chose with discretion 	3.126231226229292
but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour 	3.791755148516881
the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister ' s match , which she had feared to encourage , as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable , and at the same time dreaded to be just , from the pain of obligation , were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true ! he had followed them purposely to town , he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research 	3.410772350877662
" the idea of mr collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : " my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish 	3.554738011907598
it needed all jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity 	3.924042940069914
mr hurst also made her a slight bow , and said he was " very glad 	3.84715385505867
" " well , " cried elizabeth , " have it as you choose 	3.799380589866038
and to be kept back on such a motive ! i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind 	3.5158149246321453
because we shall see the less of him 	4.572893775138166
the others have been gone on to scarborough , these three weeks 	4.197690926157833
but however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so 	4.245674583378251
in a few minutes , mrs bennet half opened the door and called out , " lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you 	3.7316387476661124
when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent 	3.9309271918453335
" elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat 	4.313457071106495
" it would be nothing 	5.689672935863481
and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned 	3.7706277268921737
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information 	4.7032868387779025
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennet ' s ill humour or ill health 	4.363043532717282
" " it is not mr bingley , " said her husband 	4.292022106373192
but you are always giving her the preference 	4.106946683123867
they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry 	3.5619070779205515
but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity 	4.072716801097902
and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be 	3.6105614075848926
and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations 	3.545296539402268
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him ! he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! not handsome enough to dance with ! i wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs 	3.6700102097357963
nor did that day wear out her resentment 	3.711460779963195
" " but if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required 	2.883322257727928
and on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " the men shan't come and part us , i am determined 	4.008001769433411
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers 	3.2649961382542227
well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone 	3.6441952008504512
i told you in the library , you know , that i should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word 	4.21860261929204
her brother , whose eye she feared to meet , scarcely recollected her interest in the affair , and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth , seemed to have fixed them on her more , and more cheerfully 	3.813288488490911
mr collins ' s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete 	3.550304713874687
" elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact 	3.223878976849615
" " now , kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said mr bennet 	4.418907535734077
which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read 	3.894477744112714
but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love 	3.637438488080826
he did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately 	3.3221930020570922
it is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions 	3.823873748691253
redistribution is subject to the trademark license , especially commercial redistribution 	3.8030489768393054
but tell me , what did you come down to netherfield for ? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequence ? " " my real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me 	3.9861160443950685
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor 	4.065768841881686
" " indeed i could not 	3.930137675533924
elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph 	3.8010767469550464
" " you are severe on us 	3.1310064097178776
they may wish many things besides his happiness 	3.0730302700970014
he was full of joy and attention 	3.553480155639091
" " i think i have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in meryton 	3.046731637071665
the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter , and concluded with her brother ' s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country 	3.3179184347898465
or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house 	4.748075217449581
mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday 	3.811875665063827
" " well , then , you need not be under any alarm 	3.154102751109495
and the respect which he felt for her high rank , and his veneration for her as his patroness , mingling with a very good opinion of himself , of his authority as a clergyman , and his rights as a rector , made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness , self importance and humility 	4.099872411813932
" upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock 	3.3365093462076616
and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his 	4.027138076333164
but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her 	3.9297635783089526
adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it 	4.648348196375768
she read over her aunt ' s commendation of him again and again 	3.535236274091762
but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense 	3.4802319469543743
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " i beg your pardon , but i must leave you 	3.5943516833522953
and i was convinced of her affection 	4.294775202290527
well , any friend of mr bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure 	3.963997099904826
and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation 	4.024569503971833
" the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy 	3.7137513549665955
and there was no necessity for such attention 	3.897829212205597
<num>	3.986380516691557
and after all , mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance 	3.7762642277638006
but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool ' s errand again 	5.1347458114495605
avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible , saying not much to elizabeth , and nothing at all to the others 	4.475016101748648
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford 	3.4880522021645812
she is quite a little creature 	4.101915483165792
when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness 	3.5169826725099793
as it was certain , however , that somebody was coming , bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion , and walk away with him into the shrubbery 	3.8947762485654467
her power was sinking 	4.591349243608525
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before 	3.644995298055491
and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over 	3.2985194968204494
scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game , except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh ' s being too hot or too cold , or having too much or too little light 	3.271050078961045
though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour 	3.464738418881791
do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified 	4.320402188260163
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters 	3.308739437209713
" " my dear mr bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother 	3.4812525074891774
my mind was more agreeably engaged 	4.233064427316496
if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? and if i am that choice , why may not i accept him ? " " because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it 	3.253333073709953
and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second 	4.0371049783275295
but mrs bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed 	3.4875600594037057
i am going away myself 	3.8773997297987384
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends 	3.5361261949694085
" " that is the most unforgiving speech , " said elizabeth , " that i ever heard you utter 	3.738520972515929
it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane ' s attractions 	4.094855877540145
jane was beyond competition her favourite child 	3.648089390766798
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here 	3.4205291646038702
" scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to rosings 	4.453471354976128
who should do it but her own uncle ? if he had not had a family of his own , i and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents 	3.9909808806118763
it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best 	3.4914531817261363
when jane and elizabeth were alone , the former , who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before , expressed to her sister how very much she admired him 	3.79668611358127
and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first 	4.005696574766635
that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head 	4.347389922331204
such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet , and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingley ' s continued absence 	3.944739637938174
" i see what you are feeling , " replied charlotte , " you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you 	4.094184083633626
they repulsed every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins , who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests 	3.945810660459278
but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves 	3.4010812247592823
the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen 	3.2887472228485977
there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again 	3.654844941202863
pride and prejudice : a novel 	2.7344341597462027
but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment 	3.776969384645972
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying 	3.6198887082943716
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment 	4.496254055237706
elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr darcy 	3.68890760552689
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation 	3.992026173653783
let me do it without farther loss of time 	3.3925402922740275
elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution 	3.5092973922413595
" " you have only proved by this , " cried elizabeth , " that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition 	3.8050765452260116
as yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness 	4.160898964330441
they had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason 	3.7555488870858094
" " true , " said mr bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it 	3.7831328194556617
that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me 	4.60595193931498
" the period of expectation was now doubled 	3.78914156298101
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns 	3.4090689855779246
" mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply 	3.376456679198524
" lizzy , you must not do so 	4.708636552137544
it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was 	4.198830207951392
" " no 	3.300394139282302
lydia ' s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there himself 	3.6691202152820956
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet , with a polite congratulation 	4.953818715451247
but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps 	4.194136922646255
we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man 	3.8079880686192884
" i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement 	3.7697292754603904
and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again 	3.177784135630151
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint 	4.107681375330899
chapter v 	3.8875901874842507
" sir william only smiled 	4.359621102990185
end of vol 	4.548966707643553
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth 	3.5369019859227575
but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to 	4.4726261862302925
while in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ! do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ? are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? " " yes , and i had heard it before 	3.768339855951032
sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion 	3.7071313413076314
and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on : " i am now convinced , my dear aunt , that i have never been much in love 	3.977228094172436
they followed her into the dining parlour 	4.056538891768978
sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it 	3.749585204126085
in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty , who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments , to make their appearance before 	3.699562592497695
" she held out her hand 	3.7042546940446948
but who was your mother ? who are your uncles and aunts ? do not imagine me ignorant of their condition 	3.8714011866736713
for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming 	3.854837490201634

i saw them the night before last 	3.9028445185691605

mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention 	4.048425329727877
" she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged 	3.638321295822471
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds 	3.6353912265631285
but mr gardiner could not be seen , and mr darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning 	4.197350601173364
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished 	4.256848802276839
but she was proud of him 	3.212536932664325
" " and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him 	3.7786575176566735
that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! oh , lydia ! " " i comfort myself with thinking , " replied jane , " that he certainly would not marry lydia , if he had not a real regard for her 	3.7270474677662913

the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me 	4.142159858205417
it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr darcy ! it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon 	4.0488629574716
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference 	3.173633871024973
in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him 	4.513272423963246
" " indeed ! " cried wickham with a look which did not escape her 	3.53764602520443
all loveliness and goodness as she is ! her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating 	3.788624132362295
but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s frailty would have mortified her so much 	3.8049650199092184
they were to be off as soon as possible 	4.001520767579393
at such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable 	4.7260349538892
" " but , my dear , you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood 	3.031447567262383
she dared not relate the other half of mr darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend 	3.615513452834178
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season 	4.1265951137765935
he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father ' s intentions 	4.293618652203463
and that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter 	3.706654892683928
mr hurst looked at her with astonishment 	4.158222871368763
if you are a good girl for the next ten years , i will take you to a review at the end of them 	3.4766103920609384
pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself 	3.4733506798543967

but the things should be ordered immediately 	3.4623176655268355
not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the pemberley house , is a powerful motive 	4.220928481285019
believe her to be deceived by all means 	4.472856988832959
she would be in nobody ' s way , you know , in that part of the house 	4.268794814561979
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! " she was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits 	3.793766593397347
she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave 	4.304979823848999
	8.166004683736908
charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness 	3.9674479568326793
you know he is , as well as i do 	3.7861284978472387
and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected 	3.7298166694665214
and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him 	3.934092567685169
" " though it is difficult , " said jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit 	3.552439217939967
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer 	4.41929041507636
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character 	4.138706327277952
this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers , but mrs bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments , answered most readily , " you are very kind , sir , i am sure 	4.171132828606729
his character is thereby complete 	3.982372990706362
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears 	4.274411841694275
lydia was exceedingly fond of him 	3.603208353762149
i cannot but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago 	3.9170755851812205
such relief , however , as it was in her power to afford , by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences , she frequently sent them 	3.8204907836562727
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters 	3.7513457168843956

and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh 	4.1688094422360855
" " lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home 	3.479541421903197
bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed 	3.8419956222878384
but without much success 	4.822015112354912
she was humbled , she was grieved 	5.051469051046829
for who would object to such a partner ? " elizabeth looked archly , and turned away 	4.920516690159848
" elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy 	3.632314579469451
and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers 	4.01522579020168
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? " " they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible 	3.7202241689149456
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words " apology , " " hunsford , " and " lady catherine de bourgh 	4.219049474436428
and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement 	3.269322393099674
and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine 	4.397573432629519
perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me 	4.190275234988771
he readily agreed to it 	4.459745461424409
but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness 	3.211240753701915
" " what is his name ? " " bingley 	4.414271473070959
" while mary is adjusting her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to mr bingley 	4.135517821810866
and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal 	3.284114931229029
and yet , upon my honour , i believed what i said of myself to be true , and i believe it at this moment 	3.733659952163517
to the last 	5.003186950354468
she enquired after his sister , but could do no more 	4.354841579312249
and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet 	3.809582867949073
and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay 	3.5733300625280715
in three volumes 	3.389985165385635
he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend 	4.660404122417664
risk any thing rather than her displeasure 	4.463087077598313
charlotte tried to console her 	4.2340921241936345
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former 	3.591477823624497
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister ' s room , and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid , and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters 	3.9564165319367426
and do you really love him quite well enough ? oh , lizzy ! do any thing rather than marry without affection 	3.5318965454016173
but with me , it is not so 	5.223102974651122
" i know not , miss elizabeth , " said he , " whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it 	3.7030066006398714
mr wickham began the subject himself 	3.6074348376121965
and , after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table , they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper , who attended , in the absence of her daughters 	3.7758600507612186
i cannot do justice to his kindness 	3.6860033263994616
i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming 	4.051759871300398
by the author of " sense and sensibility 	1.9294170895082596
" said her sister 	5.602133764305927
and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented 	3.7547778788014075
" their party in the dining room was large , for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news : and various were the subjects which occupied them 	3.073618572422679
his pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by 	4.33406928317834
" as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth 	3.7359918148151263
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister 	3.3581911064203758
she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it 	4.465728952972866
" " it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first 	3.2792251990402255
pride & prejudice 	3.9083008719831307
" " are you , indeed ? and pray what sort of guardians do you make ? does your charge give you much trouble ? young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way 	3.201111736087611
but the case is this 	4.239246805465069
elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy , and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it 	3.337577111990283
when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings 	3.879434061421333
two of her girls had been on the point of marriage , and after all there was nothing in it 	4.1675792665791676
" " i am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly 	3.2351987447134003
she could not win him , however , to any conversation 	4.9618338604110495
but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham 	3.416253342043147
" but this was all lost upon me 	3.468466987792914
and during part of that time , mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it 	4.047016252773642
they gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound 	3.6252005831243044
mrs bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure jane would have caught cold again 	3.615172861789559
" you were mr bingley ' s first choice 	4.511784360247861
for a few minutes he was silent 	3.4171036050712154
and , on the father ' s , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families 	5.437657009690288
charles , when you build your house , i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley 	4.1295585839503675
and as for mr hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her 	3.5753292396249656
do not copy , display , perform , distribute or redistribute this electronic work , or any part of this electronic work , without prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph <num>	2.992798643856878
and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment 	3.1898485563849714
" " miss bingley told me , " said jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance 	3.6274132410334503
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose 	4.04679055560455
the advice was followed readily , for the feverish symptoms increased , and her head ached acutely 	5.242774102250206
and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam ' s and mr darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former 	3.3962490920383517
nay , were your friend lady catherine to know me , i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation 	3.8763013709239
their other engagements were few 	3.894429761924728
it became her turn to listen 	4.542615384876468
and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage 	3.25796117899576
" catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer 	3.344416883083891
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on 	3.7891252767239485
must it be so ? " " oh , lord ! yes 	4.5347184645068355
in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away 	3.7670819737402925
" " i do not believe a word of it , my dear 	3.482486169789804
this , she would not hear of 	4.9067041401025575
they will never be distressed for money 	3.7395134936658327
indeed he has no improper pride 	4.750314134283342
he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before 	3.3944468065405995
darcy took up a book 	4.319585253703526
but what does he say of the living ? " " he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only 	4.105296477867993
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching pemberley 	3.817411089628224
he has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing 	3.6952621490381774
elizabeth now began to revive 	4.187842669945432
you agree that the foundation , the trademark owner , and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual , direct , indirect , consequential , punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage 	3.298074082054187
" " let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility 	3.309499039185829
" " you mistake me , my dear 	3.5972797659396645
i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park 	3.800938561415854
" jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall 	3.608728341614876
but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor , it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper , whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield , and leave the next generation to purchase 	4.585794628037294
found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence 	4.91124605153116
you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him 	3.63082000797266
if there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence 	4.184709815059363
his plan did not vary on seeing them 	3.8852613133339053
and she turned away with alarm , while mrs reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to morrow , with a large party of friends 	4.091518402075801
he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others 	3.92222534991911
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world , though only a few weeks before , when lydia had first run away , they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune 	3.5656250884300165
others of the party were now applied to 	5.258109471589111
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together 	3.3286108733579547
his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature 	3.9882595950521145
i was right , therefore 	4.231341938027725
" " that is not an unnatural surmise , " said fitzwilliam , " but it is lessening the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly 	4.229037942087221
" " oh , well ! it is just as he chooses 	3.3828697634362954
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had miss lydia bennet come upon the town 	3.8070271996087786
though lydia had never been a favourite with them , mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeply affected 	3.986344912450925
in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self reproach 	3.944462815961558
" how could you begin ? " said she 	3.7475763811226366
" " i cannot believe it 	3.3831706851715344
your ' s , &c 	2.633258899976142
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself 	3.5253347199497305
i shall certainly try to get the better 	3.4799729485457696
" " he likes to have his own way very well , " replied colonel fitzwilliam 	4.5842302769886825
from their infancy , they have been intended for each other 	4.45812458856118

" " this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , " said he 	3.349302162102253
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man 	3.4674135269127078
she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself 	4.4663273082076875
but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success 	3.9748845460452324

" " oh ! " said lydia stoutly , " i am not afraid 	4.2077297316873485
she could think of nothing else , and yet whether bingley ' s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends' interference 	3.58093413689968
" " i like her appearance , " said elizabeth , struck with other ideas 	3.6571519068208747
but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post 	3.4581383249397013
" " i might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? was not this some excuse for incivility , if i was uncivil ? but i have other provocations 	4.066071948863084
though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it , before they did 	4.1364985450541045
" " mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself ? " " no 	3.891400168335873
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them 	3.14111776785374
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me 	3.7291638758592227
mr bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county 	3.5484648816763094

" mr and mrs gardiner smiled 	4.262943560628992
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of mr darcy ' s proposals 	3.760332796678592
" mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward 	3.402427147468197
and they pursued the accustomed circuit 	4.6719498836512505
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise 	4.072366315178335
astonishment , apprehension , and even horror , oppressed her 	5.090996076837895
but before they heard again from mr gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from mr collins 	3.9396939120266707
and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted 	3.470872460288165
she did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile 	4.293166895249394
" " tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? " though elizabeth would not , for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine , have answered this question 	3.884794104728358
but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites 	3.418565935787218
and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out 	3.7356978438018884
if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once 	3.669626583181568
the rapture of lydia on this occasion , her adoration of mrs forster , the delight of mrs bennet , and the mortification of kitty , are scarcely to be described 	4.192994516587967
but i do not know when that will be 	3.7912657184620198
the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch 	3.798336795653992
and to him she had hardly courage to speak 	3.91221604675673
what could be the meaning of it ? it was impossible to imagine 	4.083230136608954
and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations 	3.8470262540902436
and she was only sixteen last june 	3.6070141543615915
at our time of life , it is not so pleasant i can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day 	4.314153600557384
but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better 	3.5605273971495968
and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam ? what is it you are talking of ? what are you telling miss bennet ? let me hear what it is 	3.6954846588235486
by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary 	4.1944650799669345
yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of 	4.4434565608189365
the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature , must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance 	3.976155468945989
and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home 	3.5391928527754706
and from all bingley ' s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it , from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him , of their becoming hereafter her own 	3.8017950226592334
whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr darcy approaching them , and at no great distance 	4.977516171491303
and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him 	3.7880572606760516
now is your time 	4.907556075029867
" how can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! you will not be fit to be seen when you get there 	3.893033882039642
i am very , very sorry 	3.958890668417687
they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene 	3.5797605880172876
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me 	3.640581652479769
" oh ! " said she , " i heard you before 	3.7127786588512204
there is nothing else to be done 	3.7762160514273693
i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family 	4.648767943089977
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments 	3.3917795737945884
mrs gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder 	4.576137519488075
and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown 	3.5803643451739595
" " i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever 	3.3518589776467755
and it was but the other day , that i recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her 	4.229282741626286
" i know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object 	3.3979555603178357
after playing some italian songs , miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air 	4.173835227280787
" " removed ! " cried bingley 	4.475369869240872
after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read 	3.7156290525825475

and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten 	3.224405362532196
our authority was too good 	4.145013416615467
mrs bennet invited him to dine with them 	3.976468690637417
and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way 	3.5711812818572493
" " i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want 	3.5393951610183634
and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers 	3.826680864602576
but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much 	3.552686812607969
and i wish with all my heart it may prove so 	3.0243762699443093
miss bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt 	3.5739388814000796
the agitations of former partiality entirely so 	4.107562941450294
and if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london , for i am going there early in june , for a week 	3.5717866318621847
see paragraph <num>	3.9069474434092553
but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided 	3.1812487685747923
it had not been very great 	4.944617027501783
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world 	3.7781447539796407
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him 	3.6988250538933434
you are to understand , miss bennet , that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose 	3.727747133975244
" your cousin ' s conduct does not suit my feelings 	3.8237536044494878
" however little mr darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer 	3.4236916812566314
she approached , and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle piece 	3.5268414083936617
" you are a good girl 	3.2786014305666185
and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther 	3.909452404876737
but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended 	4.413597809584744
and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family 	4.379644783194631
perhaps there was some truth in this 	4.449657438123197
" there is something a little stately in him to be sure , " replied her aunt , " but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming 	4.244006621238132
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure 	4.04599929595989
i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure 	3.6261330107356065
and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out 	3.4784479534003196
" " it is well 	3.571756494101041
stop me whilst you can 	4.506008955661126
" and may i ask ? " said elizabeth , " but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with 	4.077951609794226
as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was 	4.275441957455737
but from every window there were beauties to be seen 	3.4375221461660765
" when you have killed all your own birds , mr bingley , " said her mother , " i beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on mr bennet ' s manor 	4.047814331570568
but that is one great difference between us 	3.38548729523639
i shall like it of all things 	4.121376039822124
why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the case ? " " in the first place , " replied mr gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland 	3.9000451919139913
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him 	4.515404911002042
" for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds 	3.8685448613090476
" if i should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia 	4.104605259143502
" that is all very proper and civil , i am sure , " said mrs bennet , " and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman 	3.647138448945573
" i am sorry it went off 	3.1249668528306676
thank god ! i have not that pain 	5.1021259048327705
and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her 	3.49836052439081
" " are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? " " both , " replied elizabeth archly 	3.7764848261323496
" as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane 	3.7658357495426262
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs philips ' s manners and politeness 	3.6615882082545066
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening 	3.471326561685804
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which i cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects 	3.978765171566258
" lady catherine seemed resigned 	3.485787140623245
" " i am exceedingly gratified , " said bingley , " by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper 	3.6600600398705843
" is miss darcy much grown since the spring ? " said miss bingley 	3.672228676181122
for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path 	4.1416658934044905
it was agreed to 	4.251216422923493
and she asked bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present 	4.260413166680624
perhaps he thought her too young 	4.414557498399329
and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it 	3.298817632903455
" it must not be thought of 	4.286075476762434
and i trust i am resigned 	3.7598838086840978
you mentioned two instances 	4.667388852790317
and mr darcy had much better finish his letter 	4.110184971015577
she would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home 	3.5840267048679335
nor was darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery 	4.290578313037403
widely different was the effect of a second perusal 	4.173506492763199
are you much acquainted with mr darcy ? " " as much as i ever wish to be , " cried elizabeth warmly , " i have spent four days in the same house with him , and i think him very disagreeable 	4.983249930167821
your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins , and i will never see you again if you do 	3.2554802677161674
" " your attendance upon her , has been too much for you 	3.825276695284518
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility 	3.2953004966637387
we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye 	3.5424647066706734
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement 	3.053925890410715
" but how did he account for it ? " " it must have been his sister ' s doing 	4.7383305951005
for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all 	4.05821232528874
" elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing 	3.113438480513419
" " i have not a doubt of mr bingley ' s sincerity , " said elizabeth warmly 	3.8530793668768357
" on the evening before my going to london , " said he " i made a confession to him , which i believe i ought to have made long ago 	4.20190764906224
mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party 	3.786823906699729
their situation was awkward enough 	4.118806623213086
" what , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? poor little lizzy ! but do not be cast down 	3.558680531498593
she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes 	3.635962937963538
" did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? " " from the former 	3.780030476885458
" " whatever my connections may be , " said elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you 	3.867368158766478
it was a painful , but not an improbable , conjecture 	3.5637490006068293
the horses were post 	4.453352068179864
it was all pride and insolence 	3.8231657942020454
" " with all my heart 	3.350853465267317
their lodgings were not long a secret , and at length they began to know the officers themselves 	3.7802552013236657
her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies 	3.580759928034266
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just 	3.682082578217726
" " oh ! where , where is my uncle ? " cried elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious 	3.68117932969912
" " miss bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that i am not to be trifled with 	4.48698576746206
when the tea things were removed , and the card tables placed , the ladies all rose , and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him , when all her views were overthrown , by seeing him fall a victim to her mother ' s rapacity for whist players , and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party 	3.879705363353386
and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world 	4.015191686629135
" " impossible , mr bennet , impossible , when i am not acquainted with him myself 	4.629212759080086
if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer 	4.5333480295458575
their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush 	4.6441469715471735
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so 	5.148500295642219
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire 	4.051863147921202
it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration 	4.382463624096017
but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough 	3.628746011062858
and when occasionally , unable to resist the impulse of curiosity , she raised her eyes to his face , she as often found him looking at jane , as at herself , and frequently on no object but the ground 	3.2466006673492878
its effect was most extraordinary 	4.674928749119729
but now suppose as much as you chuse 	3.3825062374726667
she was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady lucas has been very kind 	3.9797711119624837
i will only add , god bless you 	3.1621373342291297
upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself 	3.4495902916890167
we had better go into the avenue 	3.6026035021507377
in that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks 	5.180729891493297
and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible 	3.900374630348813
nothing could be more delightful ! to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love 	3.3010302124197493
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since i am well aware that it could not be complied with 	3.6601862812787895
" " we are speaking of music , madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply 	3.181257093276329
but darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious 	4.782903987907083
mr wickham had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight 	3.831340558073771
mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet , and mrs hurst was observing their game 	4.391639306237312
" implacable resentment is a shade in a character 	5.053260453933966
" a gentleman and a stranger ! it is mr bingley i am sure 	3.531765138484123
" " in my opinion , the younger son of an earl can know very little of either 	3.4511569943142404
these causes must be stated , though briefly 	5.322650918623184
mr darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours 	4.494258543248576
two days after mr bennet ' s return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her 	3.8804821006795227
" there has been many a one , i fancy , overcome in the same way 	3.96905758476118
" " who do you mean , my dear ? i know of nobody that is coming i am sure , unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in , and i hope my dinners are good enough for her 	4.083282525346911
" another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect 	4.376698961453875
i always had a value for him 	3.8009682879910436
mrs bennet ' s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " well , jane , who is it from ? what is it about ? what does he say ? well , jane , make haste and tell us 	3.5487049223596383
but i believe we must abide by our original plan 	3.721089331252515
she is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and i have no opinion of her 	4.304442627031026
there was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake 	3.994247472747042
" away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech 	3.6235830903531134
elizabeth silently attended her 	4.219598727303314
when her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication 	4.093485902991069
her father had been an attorney in meryton , and had left her four thousand pounds 	3.11754511211076
the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them 	3.3278276117982655
" he acknowledged the truth of it all 	3.7861536802903313
after making every possible enquiry on that side london , colonel f 	3.409086328048213
i assure you , that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it 	4.041560635075052
" and taking her hand , he would have given it to mr darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to sir william , " indeed , sir , i have not the least intention of dancing 	4.294512825718571
i was uncomfortable enough 	3.771784003124225
federal laws and your state ' s laws 	3.645101111064757
and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire 	3.8193556798968378
but it is so strange ! " " yes that is what makes it amusing 	3.973513531027967
no , no , let me shift for myself 	4.228396781201516
i have a warm , unguarded temper , and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely 	4.375509351584008
this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed 	4.697783802650293
the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere 	3.8479614688105617
" no 	4.9794288334192895
there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself 	3.8029052936950167
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over 	3.4894387497146697
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him 	3.9243596049086733
oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenelworth , birmingham , &c 	3.5619493140574203
he seldom appeared really animated 	4.151040646086012
recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " sir william ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of 	3.746679510538919
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes 	3.981160445521781
and mrs bennet , for many years after lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would 	4.739246344120956
and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself 	3.790140178703688
" " but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham 	2.9756774947072437
and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject 	3.2226219178213036
the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room 	3.34227355222882
" " my uncle is to send a servant for us 	3.5376960008348055
" while they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner 	3.6089186443789956
but nothing can be done 	3.918091630939436
his attachment to rosings , certainly increases 	4.5202622572616775
but does not jane correspond with the sister ? she will not be able to help calling 	4.575303904994419
she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare 	4.638869179657587

who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? " as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to london , at the same time that mr bennet came from it 	4.121959165625612
and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress 	3.717599030606342
of having another daughter married to mr collins , she thought with equal certainty , and with considerable , though not equal , pleasure 	4.408172568282665
to be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love 	3.0873008116780514
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that i am not afraid of requesting it , though i have still something more to ask of the former 	3.8788791915257375
" and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal 	5.07240302514888
if you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund 	3.193864621013569
on sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place 	3.3763781265954935
there is a lady , it seems , a mrs younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what 	4.261010402352562
but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him 	4.227736091481784
" where is your sister ? " said he hastily , as he opened the door 	4.809971960276376
with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings 	4.983078510902145
within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors 	4.029144963348613
the faces of both , however , were tolerably calm 	4.331034989261044
we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine 	3.6971058132956522
but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity 	3.93869569274527
" mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character 	3.4538120828777568
" " she did indeed , louisa 	3.752019463641672
well , he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now 	3.9665986142774368
after wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought 	3.1818750939145573
find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit her 	4.115735387578743
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men servants go with her 	3.2990373623609015
" " in point of composition , " said mary , " his letter does not seem defective 	4.303090063668538
here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell 	3.6951851868745127
and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry 	3.9113031368653797
in short , i will do my best 	4.728365534230925
it will pass away soon enough 	3.7987284158699137
she is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest 	3.394915374130141
the day passed much as the day before had done 	3.891161776886955
all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister 	3.976943492374365
but her'_ she thought was still worse 	3.9076174695337142
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable 	3.6485054229367013
" words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings 	4.840391445049163
for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone 	4.550559019269464
with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility 	4.263657685094729
" i have sent for you on an affair of importance 	3.339160825747352
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here 	3.3912674959758906
the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town 	3.8510966817660246
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town 	3.4533490039153434
and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body 	3.7613400348602406
" " mama , " cried lydia , " my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson ' s as they did when they first came 	4.043651780789877
the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock 	3.5477972784395386
in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley ' s , in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects 	3.4276644009057584
its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn 	3.8737725866659467
she was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung 	3.5298087051092173
and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces 	4.369416533494829
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me 	3.1961132023257584
" yes , she called yesterday with her father 	3.932020395653893
" " shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? " said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam 	3.398103960289773
the park paling was still the boundary on one side , and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground 	4.554977748297178
and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it 	3.20445782649917
mr hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep 	4.71722328295307
" lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ? are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? have not you always hated him ? " how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give 	3.267634300873032
" oh ! lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! if i could but see you as happy ! if there were but such another man for you ! " " if you were to give me forty such men , i never could be so happy as you 	3.7247946994387395
and unwilling for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good humoured smile , " come , mr wickham , we are brother and sister , you know 	4.341117045358161
we have certainly done our best 	3.710225069251304
" " yes , indeed , " cried mrs bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood 	3.5702420654544156
we dine at rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home 	3.6414060069884377
" oh ! mr collins ! " " my dear madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point 	4.162406143868621
" " why will you think so ? it must be his own doing 	4.151064989289001
and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate 	3.8057725622232814
" yes if darcy does not put it off again 	3.5385725689465164
and the possibility of her deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret 	4.208337670794483
we may compare our different opinions 	4.062489978826035
and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery 	3.4917892022833033
" it taught me to hope , " said he , " as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before 	3.5153378739708505
but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal 	4.031964747587912
and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins , the excellence of its cookery was owing 	3.5016493388885412
" i am afraid , mr darcy , " observed miss bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes 	4.058961003077688
and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas 	3.481447550348517
" eliza bennet , " said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own 	4.73962094902007
i quite detest the man 	4.465450067085029
pray , what is your age ? " " with three younger sisters grown up , " replied elizabeth smiling , " your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it 	3.941349588351068
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us 	3.238879689199206
and she could not help remembering what charlotte ' s opinion had always been 	3.5241507982689586
on tuesday , his wife received a letter from him 	3.6431037803480706
" " good god ! what is the matter ? " cried he , with more feeling than politeness 	3.3129458858125993
" " it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said bingley 	4.172486470740237
your ' s , &c 	2.633258899976142
her eldest daughter , she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged 	3.6234903819882756
" it is a handsome face 	3.827655345762448
" " heaven forbid ! that would be the greatest misfortune of all ! to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! do not wish me such an evil 	3.290772646545422
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this 	4.425314051954799

" " i thank you for my share of the favour , " said elizabeth 	3.4077779694791146
she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night 	3.153033204254889
i have nothing to say against him 	4.174325803747007
but against this , there were objections 	4.758033527933291
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her 	4.020587634880927
if i was to go through the world , i could not meet with a better 	4.692013292927179
" jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail 	3.7665402959089826
he leaves out half his words , and blots the rest 	4.705961660158611
you cannot have been always at longbourn 	3.9222826963084967
your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done 	3.6300966721581607
mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them 	4.115228849961823
he wrote last week to hurry my return 	3.447241704190933
the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress 	3.904014629025597
i felt nothing but surprise 	4.557350136640103
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , diffused over his face , became him 	3.3718103053801536
mr bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements 	3.6531398762782294
she was afraid of talking longer of his friend 	3.4789305162350663
he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride 	4.503273189048502
" " and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason 	3.521505891972784
so far we are equal 	4.135410685671319
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females 	3.5344349739483234
on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall 	4.392213436368007
take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one 	5.1317931558513665
" elizabeth shook her head over this letter 	3.645145567399589
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn 	3.2100000796229544
" and upon elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " lizzy , i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins 	3.350379131602308
his air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal 	3.9886546851072064
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both 	3.8707275575903237
in the former were many good paintings 	3.950676972249274
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart 	4.592216842545156
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever 	3.8348004497065666
it does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours 	3.5222369910581035
his regiment is there 	4.802091061723178
nor did he seem much more at ease 	3.708448759516245
there is something very pompous in his style 	3.7362237378605614
i believe him to be lady catherine ' s nephew 	4.870842002316899
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight 	3.2162079080380126
" replied her sister 	5.664440711167443
thus , we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition 	3.755730132254597
" lady catherine de bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately given him a living 	3.4380460292790085
but vanity , not love , has been my folly 	4.2888575894304095
in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels 	3.37894896128561
her ease and good spirits increased 	4.495880307690174
her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved 	4.130030048481396
she talked to elizabeth again and again 	3.92314291998414
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him 	3.4870962502939076
" " we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , " said elizabeth 	3.0852896580382616
for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday 	4.146007068208816
then , the two third he danced with miss king , and the two fourth with maria lucas , and the two fifth with jane again , and the two sixth with lizzy , and the boulanger " " if he had had any compassion for me , " cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much ! for god ' s sake , say no more of his partners 	4.226915280674038
the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman like set , and the best of them were of the present party 	4.341287825335628
" this fine account of him , " whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend 	4.5275184901510785
and fourthly , that the match might be broken off 	5.1064477620264865
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn 	3.4354295252667306
her hopes were answered 	4.564737781798649
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat 	4.647059263394758
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it 	4.056212147988605
" " let her be called down 	3.5416039545027336
on the following monday , mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn 	4.046693692233169
and were informed that it was but just done , to give pleasure to miss darcy , who had taken a liking to the room , when last at pemberley 	4.7769195999871075
against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked 	5.119302391752313
but still he would be her husband 	4.318113556766605
no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it 	3.9849601515868773
are you going much farther ? " " no , i should have turned in a moment 	3.8568353679263336
" for my own part , " she rejoined , " i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her 	4.5393312186641
our poor mother is sadly grieved 	4.228645758481555
mr bennet ' s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort 	3.987645036806481
but lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me 	4.297319521496153
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph 	4.438668075253975
through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance 	4.015346668778902
you must feel it 	3.5962563038829947
no one but mrs bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short 	3.857357273655999
after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud 	3.6784758100384574
i cannot think so very ill of wickham 	3.425624155886998
her ladyship ' s carriage is regularly ordered for us 	3.3598392182469077
" " i never can be thankful , mr bennet , for any thing about the entail 	3.8482572223751346
with a book he was regardless of time 	4.81227997922423
but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued 	3.4163759662659823
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes 	3.5768210746711633
colonel fitzwilliam ' s manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings 	3.608785444700652
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins 	3.7190515999542897
it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground 	2.9067895255914604
and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to 	3.8235660462615857
for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before 	3.923129060896127
with your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! affectation of candour is common enough 	3.6309216070810804
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy 	3.930071073441951
" elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case 	3.951144482379785
" " you are all kindness , madam 	3.2714022169078434
and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year 	3.5138131042323146
" " colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia ' s side , but nothing to give him any alarm 	3.6686362186878836
such very superior dancing is not often seen 	4.088776072779527
her keenest attention was awakened 	4.243929603894041
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas ' s last week 	3.4456500842383226
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant 	3.583597231561999
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies 	3.7741334644577065
" she cried 	3.38416065133247
elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings 	4.125649916139506
at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband 	4.337682482863245
pray forgive me , if i have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from p 	4.913175560680669
the housekeeper came 	4.497404088432297
let wickham be your man 	4.304474953241181
" " miss elizabeth bennet ! " repeated miss bingley 	3.5864110817813866
a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented 	3.7966496566693815
" " i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness 	3.723296287331655
and so would anne , if her health had allowed her to apply 	3.6405997862195933
i knew nothing at all of lady catherine ' s connections 	4.308434407610488
the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr darcy could not have 	3.7996173277633747
her own thoughts were employing her 	4.323185397504693
the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father 	5.265638744344717
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there 	3.1838283315175553
how shall we punish him for such a speech ? " " nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said elizabeth 	4.260554583253126
your alliance will be a disgrace 	4.102750274993387
lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath 	3.5246815159948133

but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed 	4.052203144297223
iii 	7.579537113416177
" she then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two 	3.7592574215667236
" " good gracious ! mr darcy ! and so it does i vow 	3.608746562171671
he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily 	4.192155935892537

he placed himself by her 	4.439210029705904
" it certainly is a most iniquitous affair , " said mr bennet , " and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn 	3.790844414448474
in confirmation of this , she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected , without actually naming her authority , but stating it to be such as might be relied on 	4.323631456938321
" " another time , lizzy , " said her mother , " i would not dance with him , if i were you 	4.410573236365047
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr collins was only a clergyman 	4.101546188229122
the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen 	3.848232975330994
" but mr gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears 	4.349686479702631
" she did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go 	5.730098901206735
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness 	3.7228027813042743
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment 	3.620423117373993
her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way 	4.251425066021388
and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle 	4.215137930438722
" when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence 	3.7880429299852842

" " well , and what news does it bring ? good or bad ? " " what is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from his pocket 	3.7027015315036436
" his daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative 	3.5566126258869972
my objections to the marriage were not merely those , which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case 	3.714336918051271
and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment 	3.3367094817170533
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace 	3.8365216011835077
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of mr collins 	4.58795093788993
there are few people whom i really love , and still fewer of whom i think well 	3.6947764102649163
her ' s lasted a little longer 	5.737378473917077
well , much good may it do them ! and so , i suppose , they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead 	3.098146729610474
" she wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen miss bingley 	4.197608120687962
from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane , and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along , and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton , which he never failed coming to inform them of , though it happened almost every day 	3.6425179506690952
i should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship 	3.3388403698398412
mr darcy had been at her sister ' s wedding 	4.242014043118113
and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look 	3.5554572095201666
but sir william ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together 	3.673186531612319
" " you are then resolved to have him ? " " i have said no such thing 	3.574940163089519
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more 	3.4449962794212667
he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it 	4.52941566277161
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters 	3.9433081316710097
" " i will not be interrupted 	3.608156487621727
for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company 	3.8734428571080977
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth 	3.3516076397238415
" on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " did not you think , mr darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ? " " with great energy 	3.786626222565283
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem 	3.56251628162321
the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet i think it is well expressed 	3.7742929304197914
" mr gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from colonel forster 	3.0132397045589014
but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield 	3.6151139924675824
he has been accused of many faults at different times 	3.492353100019742
wretched , wretched , mistake ! " darcy made no answer 	3.2999539479548434
she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself 	3.214516928992347
on distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities 	3.8545647618127226
but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on 	3.6592884338621396
mrs bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of 	3.592044256765812
" " are they indeed ? " cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction 	3.9069001474744094
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high 	3.639599345063083
and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him , as well as by his evident admiration of her , of her former favourite george wickham 	3.9656887035429245
mary was the only daughter who remained at home 	3.863459829715324
do let me ask my partner to introduce you 	3.431238867488163
you may ask questions , which i shall not choose to answer 	4.3588532185446205
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill 	3.644190066606546
she had ventured only one glance at darcy 	3.571829020283742
but however he did not 	4.799218382385507
i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company 	4.3943438311514305
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately 	3.5301625805300656
maria would tell her nothing more , and down they ran into the dining room , which fronted the lane , in quest of this wonder 	3.8526035421487466
elizabeth was not comfortable 	3.90319668996505
" jane looked at her doubtingly 	3.3799930436405057
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley 	3.790618729688415
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book 	3.7312317667709114
he is his own master 	4.1281938360867665
but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere 	3.9822760704242475
the wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke 	3.402401536606772
and if she would give him leave , would take an early opportunity of waiting on them 	3.157285033698763
do you play and sing , miss bennet ? " " a little 	4.161011917607173
" mrs bennet ' s eyes sparkled 	3.6633772112755723
" " no i cannot talk of books in a ball room 	2.862205053286137
and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were i distractedly in love with him , i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance 	3.72811648301904
but i am at his disposal 	3.434350889240564
mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off 	3.5423063323888697
they came 	5.730931687474305
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all <num> states of the united states 	3.612659688568441
hear me in silence 	5.423105462063356
" elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling 	3.7413179111851513
" i have an excessive regard for jane bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and i wish with all my heart she were well settled 	3.437654048869726
the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house 	4.343139124846361
" " i believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied wickham 	3.437854507833487
we had better not mention it 	3.8674374544067427
caroline did not return my visit till yesterday 	3.806600482592736
but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just 	2.954085084399027
and depend upon it , mr bingley never stirs without him 	3.600255093577233
that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world 	3.6777666755403366
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room 	3.3676724678143684
" " you observed it , mr darcy , i am sure , " said miss bingley 	3.3972659271291747
miss bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when jane testified such concern in parting with her , that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present 	4.082248023125967
but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts 	4.8777803684500896
and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again 	4.041666454093828
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty 	3.9630048477680457
not like the wild young men now a days , who think of nothing but themselves 	3.5406156376923215
his belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice 	3.8505091899057904
the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd 	4.284922368496788
you and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , mr bingley might like you the best of the party 	3.7262781454393954
he had by that time reached it also , and holding out a letter , which she instinctively took , said with a look of haughty composure , " i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you 	4.367922235348249
" my dear , dear lydia ! " she cried : " this is delightful indeed ! she will be married ! i shall see her again ! she will be married at sixteen ! my good , kind brother ! i knew how it would be i knew he would manage every thing 	3.1289691233262347
she was now in an irritation as violent from delight , as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation 	4.082677370930508
and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of " lord , how tired i am ! " accompanied by a violent yawn 	3.2434273005743197
" " i think you said she was a widow , sir ? has she any family ? " " she has one only daughter , the heiress of rosings , and of very extensive property 	4.195422900694271
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet 	3.4983193189548834
do not let us quarrel about the past 	3.569354004812259
wickham will never marry a woman without some money 	3.670551792351588

he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind 	3.9048411516424424
in understanding darcy was the superior 	4.41608528565491
but she checked herself 	3.9627705099363135
he was her dear wickham on every occasion 	3.803977807058703
and while sir william accompanied him , charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help 	3.7192223887425535
" and of this place , " thought she , " i might have been mistress ! with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted ! instead of viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt 	3.640450049759941
" " were it certain that lady catherine would think so , " said mr collins very gravely " but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you 	4.156276287028038
" i am all astonishment 	3.977215058186674
the possibility of meeting mr darcy , while viewing the place , instantly occurred 	4.410338640352408
she will make him a very proper wife 	4.263271480284113
" if we make haste , " said lydia , as they walked along , " perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes 	3.816127547942095
" yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " i remember hearing you once say , mr darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable 	4.223097247926625

it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy 	3.38476927721068
i had often seen him in love before 	4.085410676805393
she could think only of her letter 	3.7280969497916385
elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill 	3.668254676108004
though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother 	3.7885728683142803
he looked serious as usual 	3.8803995686353745
but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence 	3.4800980324227764
in the hall they parted 	4.040584139486441
and on the part of mrs bennet and kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what elizabeth felt 	4.020456939346584
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcy that mr darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground 	4.0635614335336205
i thank you , again and again , for not going to the lakes 	3.9635375734336593
and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect 	4.185743455052357

" believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections 	3.8804503277980342
mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves 	3.3881219656886143

i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to 	3.0970992651754967

" " kitty has no discretion in her coughs , " said her father 	4.621239166798232

such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house 	3.2837236968365917
not a syllable was uttered by either 	3.0780404936546697
while these newly born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing 	4.4846037371486736
she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening 	3.8689437208362913
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband 	5.954622966611333

" i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society 	4.017604299777231
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention 	4.149059026673354
" let me first see how he behaves , " said she 	4.31412941336558

jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected 	4.18665197312548
and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to 	3.5850586149943995
and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world 	4.958763025278353

" " perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh , " said elizabeth 	3.1756140439246474
" but to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable 	3.3996762469252606
" " what you ask , " said elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side 	4.107075585389985

the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband , might then have rested in its proper place 	4.2806198330082825
jane ' s temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart 	3.9595781684772495
" every body was surprised 	5.025997969831857

" elizabeth could bear it no longer 	3.3842625085910165
mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty 	3.7533299109871043
as no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all mr collins ' s scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton 	3.7758022863381164

the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident 	3.411646302698066
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters 	3.9465325779081306

as for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence 	3.228847048200491
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation 	3.160894214072984

elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could 	3.2318775102299693

they battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved 	3.360056230049517
but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone 	3.9751159860454326

good girl ! it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingley ' s pretended regard 	6.1057604461434485
mr bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters 	3.7892813911795318
i enquired after their brother , of course 	4.568372109276812
" now i am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself 	4.406818913445322
" " aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield , and he could not help answering her 	4.1304305391968335
his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity 	3.5249116635485236
wickham is safe 	5.23817869573457
don't think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side 	4.114378068905497
and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which jane was equally eager to satisfy 	3.481314424987374
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham 	3.5386412183047407
and pride has often been his best friend 	3.9994624700876997
how long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am i to wish you joy ? " " that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask 	3.506463538599238
she coloured as she spoke 	4.5964638498289005
there was now an interest , however , in believing the housekeeper 	4.048930864347099
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine 	4.498123202098002
and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical 	4.528165946577234
i know very well that nothing can be done 	2.9234749146930876
forgive me 	5.123449345411409
in <num>, the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg tm and future generations 	3.164380275171074
jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from caroline 	3.8351072285389254
i had not been long in hertfordshire , before i saw , in common with others , that bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country 	3.698464363798212
he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else 	4.1174126121603
for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match 	3.533834444609047
my father bears it better 	4.06056700267322
" very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ? " " i have , sir 	4.088673862913614
it was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes 	3.4695088295784777
i should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing 	4.323192165222537
and even mr darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done 	4.081970714181634
miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy , her sister scarcely less so 	4.289952218736793
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak 	4.009230455740374
and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief 	3.323203720594265
and she told me that it was certain true 	4.813984451168982
" of what are you talking ? " " of mr collins and lizzy 	5.08485322034289
mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate , pressing her to try some other dish , and fearing she were indisposed 	3.193074394984081
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt 	3.584628126130014
never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings 	3.369072327024899
you will be a very happy woman 	4.836837689351411
miss bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room 	4.18619689137324
he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr gardiner 	4.1961579194168035
and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement 	3.914348457556014
but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent 	4.141464681502341
* * * * * in the evening , soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme 	3.877881753286796
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces 	4.158947529221456
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth ' s performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste 	3.664825509573477
but it is all , all too late now 	3.812693509203174
you and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us 	3.8502823647481885
but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing 	3.603466387553537
about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire , to which he belonged 	3.8559149865400593
you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its being _ 	4.517533796823205
" " upon my word , " said her ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person 	3.5056329902468955
and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections 	4.0063594923915025
by elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself 	3.4845256755770717
" " an excellent consolation in its way , " said elizabeth , " but it will not do for us 	3.6744722478057934
" " and what arts did he use to separate them ? " " he did not talk to me of his own arts , " said fitzwilliam smiling 	4.12890825574893
and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was 	3.728228764120379
so imprudent a match on both sides ! but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood 	3.8853862565589776
i was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit 	4.050942988511591
" " but you are not entitled to know mine 	3.45107645877131
but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body 	3.184338798842332
" elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that 	3.914062016961047
and besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites 	3.93890660005995
" mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet 	3.970192144211039
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone 	3.0608071950197764
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together 	3.564283803937396
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth 	3.905330048815365
it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could feel gratitude , i would now thank you 	3.8097171273383905
and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the door 	3.68688754482204
he is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably 	4.3691275529402525
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes 	4.458038974494618
elizabeth was determined 	3.8831484950568096
till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation , colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself 	4.2960645050169
not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body 	3.585466009210994
" and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case 	5.083876148659607
" but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer 	3.39674500780913
did you see it ? " bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations 	4.395805614055749
but every body is to judge for themselves , and the lucases are very good sort of girls , i assure you 	3.9327364682165546
and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride 	4.1949676581259
nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states 	3.013638365318317
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week 	3.60452631019906
your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic 	4.310681589128872
his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family 	3.8334654233285868
and she seized the opportunity of saying , " is your sister at pemberley still ? " " yes , she will remain there till christmas 	3.8288169442675812
she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins 	4.048378900025275
" " and what is your success ? " she shook her head 	3.073805467479832
" having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority 	3.5177821178388773
he does not want abilities 	4.909599013787838
here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse 	3.6674561379270534
but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs bennet ' s curiosity 	4.403880135506854
newby chief executive and director gbnewby<mention>	4.567506170481119
when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little 	4.091185546699463
now , seriously , what have you ever known of self denial and dependence ? when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? " " these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature 	3.2939751795207175
she had always seen it with pain 	3.463825343135738
it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind 	3.921537416105455
can he be a sensible man , sir ? " " no , my dear 	3.791986267271827
" " i am sorry you think so 	3.3402687687443993
there ' s for you ! she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool 	4.0964036034463565
&c 	7.474864875761745
and he was always the sweetest tempered , most generous hearted , boy in the world 	3.2069566271912375
and mr gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia 	3.864464400462815
her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men 	4.0064568725019765
but he is an ugly fellow ! i am glad he is gone 	3.9217872759162855
at length , however , our kind friend procured the wished for direction 	3.209518830037713
but , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ' s 	3.8891337631851437
" yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed 	3.7584562598390385
there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him 	4.127581953641137
he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and that , if he marry prudently , his wife may teach him 	4.434588964091632
but we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation 	6.059641379716898
<num>	3.986380516691557
" " but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? " " it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister ' s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt 	3.9310971781962434
" " you saw me dance at meryton , i believe , sir 	3.516005749642989
and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time 	3.1497492860413914
if an individual work is in the public domain in the united states and you are located in the united states , we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying , distributing , performing , displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg are removed 	2.991451419271884
" miss bingley made no answer 	3.035368286807009
and mr collins was to attend them , at the request of mr bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself 	4.208395312742021
and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort 	3.6342375802379174
can i speak plainer ? do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart 	3.509111553659448
their mutual affection will steady them 	3.6815716902698052
a scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful 	3.887150137933962
had lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned 	3.4219120363078654
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton ! i owe all that i know of it , to another , not to you 	4.239644484626241
and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs collins ' s joints of meat were too large for her family 	3.558074250994824
elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation 	3.5506569266664636
but what could set you off in the first place ? " " i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation 	4.065264477898862
about the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon 	3.41819204263583
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live 	3.704004279578849
" " oh ! it is of no consequence 	3.824539016105106
when they sat down to supper , therefore , she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other 	3.0730805243181623
you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself 	4.697763151064033
when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever 	4.107210128921549
and she was more grieved than astonished to hear , in reply to her minute enquiries , that though jane always struggled to support her spirits , there were periods of dejection 	3.4863102988227146
dear me ! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster ' s 	3.6925045844795865
" my dear father , i congratulate you 	3.447364155087254
bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the principal object 	5.06282373016747
why does she not come in ? " " oh ! charlotte says , she hardly ever does 	3.9727772833023676
it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect 	4.0168034791325224
my mother was in hysterics , and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done ! but the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties 	4.216566702586181
chapter xxiii 	2.9674598914339794
wholly inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one ' s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever 	4.527625142784119
it is impossible 	3.7339479400822184
and in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away 	3.105765348705184
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire 	3.2085579369843273
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " how long did you say that he was at rosings ? " " nearly three weeks 	4.644806536197335
my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed ! but perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design 	3.667287912539708
and by a manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family 	3.6534267258695072
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer 	3.2967810490594247
their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general 	4.083172397664735
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of 	3.966775242665044
" oh ! my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately 	3.4825971762844596
" " but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out 	3.3307868828474696
additional terms will be linked to the project gutenberg tm license for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work 	3.217119251945676
but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day 	4.348516817155585
mr darcy was writing , and miss bingley , seated near him , was watching the progress of his letter , and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister 	3.8091368002533565
but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting 	4.9872873865343665
condolence , insufferable 	4.429028936578073
i cannot understand it 	3.9276226406764096
bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever 	3.526665414838893
he shall be mercenary , and she shall be foolish 	4.598217107255889
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information 	3.152946855757348
it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it 	4.214380376940037
what will you think of my vanity ? i believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses 	3.770417334553513
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility 	4.169718412763149
" " yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever 	4.049616893817921
i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley 	3.8959731414428895
i am perfectly satisfied 	3.186944753415491
i will try again 	3.9924802588113115
rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother in law ' s intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit 	4.397893547774325
my dear lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us 	3.6884885779180188
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished 	4.0746125613237645
" we can all plague and punish one another 	3.457555984731008
bingley is most unaffectedly modest 	4.392973028841056
and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former 	3.8521255418013904
" there were some very strong objections against the lady , " were colonel fitzwilliam ' s words , and these strong objections probably were , her having one uncle who was a country attorney , and another who was in business in london 	2.917351663453552
to the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long 	4.213355855412389
" " did not you ? i did for you 	3.3195659910568946
" " but she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow 	3.926860434787594
but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty 	3.8320356179365573
if this be the case , he deserves you 	4.1129805010513465
are the others coming out ? " " i do not know 	3.847282104296497
" " you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy ? " " indeed i am 	3.6984606430271976
" " and men take care that they should 	3.6890418280401605
" " in such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of 	3.8608833545821475
" " true 	2.910926787581946
she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother 	3.4415433086824576
elizabeth was delighted 	4.302665515106421
he carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity 	4.4070708351651176
the letter was to this effect : " my dear lizzy , " i wish you joy 	4.182633095606393
but no , " recollecting herself , " that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : i should not have been allowed to invite them 	4.076613500318074
vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously 	3.890018529552448
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected 	3.3855658780095674
consider how important every moment is , in such a case 	4.196198104489582
if that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon 	4.666984639497512
" " i have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two 	3.7693073474643777
till i can forget his father , i can never defy or expose him 	4.020283579539736
he has not an ill natured look 	3.9136461926415604
but what is that to me ? if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh 	3.6907995181739994
i do not know who is good enough for him 	2.9727752451247165
" yours , &c 	2.990907055261009
" i admire all my three sons in law highly , " said he 	3.850347806236453
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing 	3.9769189195960295
and after laughing at her some time , allowed her at last to go saying , as she quitted the room , " if any young men come for mary or kitty , send them in , for i am quite at leisure 	3.7793438463334224
in three volumes 	3.389985165385635
* * * * * " good gracious ! " cried mrs bennet , as she stood at a window the next morning , " if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley ! what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? i had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company 	3.5957019039539637
or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was 	3.977392028296491
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition 	3.6171061619662916
pray do not talk of that odious man 	3.934199619677747
as it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents 	3.4924652798790885
" before they were separated by the conclusion of the play , she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer 	3.421434673108598
" " i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us 	3.186691044831738
and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions 	4.239101283134233
and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army 	3.234073897523281
the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn , and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement 	3.3049130492670997
how can you be so teazing ? " " i honour your circumspection 	4.11145453405695
she is almost three and twenty ! lord , how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty ! my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands , you can't think 	3.2848195521151746
and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say , three very silly sisters 	3.3701381510322457
and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence 	3.519207845765047
and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds 	4.254882823495265
" " what sort of a girl is miss darcy ? " he shook his head 	3.318885154989569
" elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts 	3.4849347882929824
" " you are mistaken 	2.824732978521437
what a contrast between him and his friend ! mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party 	3.7403515836458863
and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars 	4.053770689293391
and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary 	3.74275383651393
and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible 	3.895306213041315
and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to mrs hill and the two housemaids 	3.28823968698366
yes , she will do for him very well 	4.220619327713537
" " let me write for you , " said jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself 	3.908085161250766
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family 	3.231139863233919
" who can it be ? " " some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose 	5.27207700403872
" " insolent girl ! " said elizabeth to herself 	4.57472956806051
as for their mother , mr collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters 	3.9042274139570203
and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley 	3.2258978837916836
she has known him only a fortnight 	3.7205328869676486
but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour 	3.450683445969227
my youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who i believe will soon become a part of the family 	3.5334978441097458
" you have insulted me , in every possible method 	5.166221275813232
you can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full project gutenberg tm license when you share it without charge with others 	3.1160932491010778
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects 	2.893229458150514
and i never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! " " he is also handsome , " replied elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can 	4.1588134630892934
for on first hearing it , mrs bennet sat quite still , and unable to utter a syllable 	3.324207367372543
and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken 	4.0845179612132485
here , sarah , come to miss bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown 	4.312834836607525
it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried 	3.747782576649478
it would be dreadful ! she blushed at the very idea 	3.954328699369295
and mrs collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much 	3.4841215942932613
and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of lady catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough 	3.51634118146172
" " oh ! do not repeat what i then said 	3.2597363652915656
yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance 	3.503274103541566
" i have every reason in the world to think ill of you 	4.029367550076291
" if i had been able , " said she , " to carry my point of going to brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened 	4.100823962804325
" " but you how are you ? " cried elizabeth 	3.067239255491202
" " but my father cannot 	3.754192896689599
" " yes , very indifferent indeed , " said elizabeth , laughingly 	3.3477183255206895
" it was the prospect of constant society , and good society , " he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the shire 	3.913826939460118
" " certainly , my dear , nobody said there were 	3.5848104183513287
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother 	3.364708434550344
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above 	4.094265771763765
if an individual project gutenberg tm electronic work is posted with the permission of the copyright holder , your use and distribution must comply with both paragraphs <num>	2.564043980619881
ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination 	4.102770461256173
mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy 	3.825075429309816
" miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour 	4.460794227234483
neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach 	3.4811380817040143
the gentlemen did approach 	4.058573882429036
" wickham only shook his head 	3.237250096908502
" " sir , you quite misunderstand me , " said mrs bennet , alarmed 	4.029553698311013
i wonder what he can be doing there 	3.904319726073894
he then said , " i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly 	3.6837922318486407
talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife 	3.5873041863580797
you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly 	5.819972874552665
and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good 	3.94439258932965
and when i returned home , the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight ' s time 	3.2446336094398376
elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word 	3.0191301360053355
" elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight 	3.022174240580174
she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us 	4.7947296507853885
though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced 	3.835315100743989
he was too happy , however , to need much attention 	3.8203487476152773
and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome 	3.4758020991493317
there was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies 	3.2435148297270997
" " neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance 	3.864791416963277
it is useless to talk of it 	3.686406414658234
" she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " oh ! mr bennet , you are wanted immediately 	4.204718440198236
had she found jane in any apparent danger , mrs bennet would have been very miserable 	4.263323045358377
indeed , you must have seen it in the papers 	4.954326353371454
" i want to know , " said she , with a countenance no less smiling than her sister ' s , " what you have learnt about mr wickham 	4.647958719215964
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master 	3.39249661496757
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage 	3.229263298268688
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there 	4.6118810053107735
" " elizabeth , you are not serious now 	4.707042293081523
but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead 	3.4634186346627165
i shall never forget her appearance this morning 	3.189837502484412
the other is miss de bourgh 	3.8869626551218426
she had set her heart on seeing the lakes 	3.3969905396785487
the hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised 	4.342076912723956
and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more 	3.5023526764768866
and perhaps he might be doing the same 	4.507147800921916
" i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her 	4.08251356994909
my sister , i am sure , will not hear of her removal 	4.077669726714594
but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance 	4.577335808302832
every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away 	4.455766092861145
" " no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did 	3.621660117367095
in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected conversation 	3.71313460615555
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned 	3.640686333306364
" " and that is quite impossible 	3.6211288865957703
when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go 	3.478454586796803
for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible 	3.608731320091435
and detestable as such a step must make her were it known , she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go 	3.8830933689112612
" mrs reynolds ' s respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master 	3.795152521735177
" elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book 	3.776080333877767
" and that , " said mrs reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master and very like him 	3.9519408822988424
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley 	3.69079256015203
and oh ! how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner 	3.7613778706897074
hart was the originator of the project gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone 	3.9807189557473253
and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room 	3.6624165182207946
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did 	4.084370339564583
" " i will not trust myself on the subject , " replied wickham , " i can hardly be just to him 	4.2915498151623375
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it 	3.4326136875679887
and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea 	3.4290277707593373
" " if you were aware , " said elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner 	3.578411993628302
and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards 	3.5218874411903225
" " and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " " my father is gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle ' s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , i hope , in half an hour 	3.5497076160977135
" " what do you mean , hill ? we have heard nothing from town 	2.8876338381287887
they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence 	4.0155438588895676
but though jane would have defended either or both , had they appeared to be wrong , she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister 	3.9184135176563717
but at length was reduced to be reasonable 	3.306350015336387
however , i recollected afterwards , that if he had been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for mr darcy might have done as well 	3.9902524334526746
he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired , and they stood together on the lawn 	3.537839624453334
" the effect was immediate 	4.050659427614297
between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard 	3.820110541758399
if you'll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight 	4.128692235448148
his father , miss bennet , the late mr darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had 	4.740020440718121
i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you 	3.5665248431651575
oh ! why is not every body as happy ? " elizabeth ' s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express 	3.4620495087189522
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted 	3.669791998921653
" " i deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried elizabeth 	2.952649277222094
this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together 	4.696674978283911
and they have another , who lives somewhere near cheapside 	3.725303727022222
" " my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , eliza , " said charlotte 	4.271922344299389
i do not wish to avoid the walk 	4.303275993965115
chapter v 	3.8875901874842507
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day 	4.373198158499483
and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation 	4.528139475433683
i saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it 	3.2888558516013005
mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility 	3.581617067659253
" though it had not occurred to me before 	4.620757466740241
about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london 	5.048395140912026
" but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome 	3.545184850244689
" the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret 	3.9594243441362225
when alone with elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject 	3.8287369921790457
and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him 	3.5408516108112473
coaxed and threatened her by turns 	6.6649431179678835
when the ladies returned to the drawing room , there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk , which she did without any intermission till coffee came in , delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted 	3.973243269259822
miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous 	3.8649332248046955
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last 	3.508907580113262
miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before 	3.5643626396884103

i defy even sir william lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son in law 	3.3188482497841587
" consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility 	4.011756611385118
she went on 	5.299212484453496
steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her 	3.8889720580374476
and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body 	3.8982080790363365
and she read it again 	4.148741659328886
do we ? " darcy had walked away to another part of the room 	3.977839409159547
" they are all silly and ignorant like other girls 	3.4263828427753613
i know how much you dislike him 	4.0395543061375685

chapter i 	3.5681501501050112
" and , before she could reply , he added , " it is above eight months 	4.062546983174655
i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt 	3.2979988389958352
but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved 	3.492617568530543
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure 	3.9080091892636046
except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph <num>	2.7686812298261043
but their progress was slow , for mr gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little 	3.89831327382218
it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go 	3.503993404870132
" my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table 	3.6900152737397436
chapter iii 	3.5373914463628107
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear 	4.0222467065342995
these two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber 	3.2253876391462795
he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it 	3.5437486659823296

and if i was her , i would not have put up with it 	4.644785229770199
young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life 	3.7291663177035272
" can you deny that you have done it ? " she repeated 	4.76115269001452
and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man 	4.40563043075248
lydia came to us 	4.910074322756296
you cannot refuse to dance , i am sure , when so much beauty is before you 	3.7871323655695606
that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance 	3.7221117102135093
it was gratitude 	4.402102847004105
but it would not do 	4.862004338863368
i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr darcy ' s regard 	3.565032633671663
they could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for mr darcy 	4.306873335709301
but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " i saw you look at me to day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report 	3.9801899523452877
will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him 	3.938223750137067
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began 	4.087864844423309
as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them 	3.829707416159755
and his behaviour , so strikingly altered , what could it mean ? that he should even speak to her was amazing ! but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting 	3.5559863649367838
when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses 	4.184795240927263
when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do 	3.821504975013481
" " with the officers ! " cried lydia 	3.9035835520925386
but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up 	3.9472430548232387
" pray do , my dear miss lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves 	3.855721798352916
i pity , though i cannot help blaming her 	4.285745815717105
elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , " you mean to frighten me , mr darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well 	4.022075877711015
the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants 	3.6820060197608653
" and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your _ make such an exhibition 	3.4148480923571003
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general 's regiment , now quartered in the north 	3.7131260953436542
though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them 	4.445464656572437
and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged jane to borrow mr bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made 	3.7009937209654376
nor could she for a moment repent her refusal , or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again 	3.1206982586964185
they had not been long together , before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her 	3.5423392376388603
lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself 	3.811563184139405
" if it were merely a fine house richly furnished , " said she , " i should not care about it myself 	3.7482776898769483
who should suffer but myself ? it has been my own doing , and i ought to feel it 	4.365751659525919
" " what think you of books ? " said he , smiling 	3.725730657449749
" if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " i shall know how to understand it 	3.854247481931133
" it is a long time , mr bingley , since you went away , " said mrs bennet 	3.922858243206583
and you , yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him 	3.5299232232764317
" " it ought to be so 	3.5951062988498257
" but what is to be done about pemberley ? " cried mrs gardiner 	3.7250924311005575
for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction 	4.859702608204496
hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called 	4.253916853928793
happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over ! " " i wish i could say any thing to comfort you , " replied elizabeth 	3.9770731479875554
" " and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry ? did he know of their intending to go off ? had colonel forster seen denny himself ? " " yes 	2.9922390698501293
anxiety on jane ' s behalf , was another prevailing concern , and mr darcy ' s explanation , by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion , heightened the sense of what jane had lost 	4.094625176020872
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants 	4.04963457911142
it cannot be done too much 	3.9386496879871995
it was a large , well proportioned room , handsomely fitted up 	3.288664132581857
it mortifies me 	3.8765366588812804
i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long 	4.05530670183157
and miss lucas , who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment , cared not how soon that establishment were gained 	3.5792266102672623
very nonsensical to come at all ! why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? her hair so untidy , so blowsy ! " " yes , and her petticoat 	4.241405483347615
but his father ' s uncommon attachment to me , irritated him i believe very early in life 	4.110391804189652
the happiness which this reply produced , was such as he had probably never felt before 	3.811029611284418
" haye park might do , " said she , " if the gouldings would quit it , or the great house at stoke , if the drawing room were larger 	4.521377407022309
and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe 	3.5559232741227205
for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious 	3.742796379241846
adieu 	7.0427649744280645
and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy 	3.7761859670058167
will you tell me how long you have loved him ? " " it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began 	4.160014033204332
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss bingley ' s voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family 	3.4026979996226014
" the introduction , however , was immediately made 	4.277043948333827
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to mrs collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered 	3.4569807520337075
what i have to say relates to poor lydia 	3.9365261708832215
if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence 	3.3023233555385576
she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address 	4.012739986357554
they will have nothing else to do 	3.673179950677052
after a short silence , the lady first spoke 	3.4416613052285427
do you often dance at st 	3.577315153350876
" " you appear to me , mr darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection 	3.7289185888047327
mrs gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head 	3.1471075400518904
and it is that which makes the wonder 	3.6211469468578654
and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him 	3.261001552747779
no arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune 	3.6231105056647785
yet he knew to the contrary himself 	3.931848852582265
as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring 	4.55278980912723
chapter xi 	3.5396391012611037
but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant ' s commission in the shire 	3.9423233632379735
" " yes 	2.5913572305001953
how he lived i know not 	4.0190340814975745
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcy ' s pleasure in the bingleys' invitation to the officers 	4.020102390161894
his consenting to marry her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking 	4.450960921643763

i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time 	2.8975710785923443
since her father ' s death , her home has been london , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education 	3.9256770558717458
" mr wickham ' s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family 	3.547337641506986
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life 	3.728343357962817
" 'tis an etiquette i despise , " said he 	4.2319272978134075
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week 	3.4316726162025315
since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud 	4.390880073828454
gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection 	4.934209683980692
wickham ' s affection for lydia , was just what elizabeth had expected to find it 	4.472854009748563
lydia the humiliation , the misery , she was bringing on them all , soon swallowed up every private care 	5.292551559378851
her features , though not plain , were insignificant 	4.411739523426507
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room 	3.5516079839248
" " i did not think you would 	3.617909938573505

he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield 	3.0763685925528605
for he is now in the custody of his friend , and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london ! my dear aunt , how could you think of it ? mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month ' s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it 	4.358250640112161

" " well , " said charlotte , " i wish jane success with all my heart 	3.8402687113575795
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards 	4.210543410608715
mrs bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment 	3.347815353971481
but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer 	3.79076979154629

in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better 	3.5586717330577837
first of all , he asked miss lucas 	5.336112427276146

and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia ' s leaving home 	3.554901155342892
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom 	3.8201659384110496
on being made acquainted with the present mr darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured boy 	4.162169556618353

he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world 	3.4946690437733516

she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise 	4.0065227557981045
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet ' s general habits , she was absolutely incredulous here 	4.840609415297338
" of a fine , stout , healthy love it may 	4.72564642247862
in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her 	3.917647920839851
but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice 	2.9989088888644195
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing 	3.6719480607502972

" when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense 	4.009174125090684

it will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance 	3.349911354271092
lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly marked features , which might once have been handsome 	3.1253793960146345
" but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago 	4.096853275926875
my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour 	3.5416281990720595
his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire 	3.399341596979362
i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all 	3.9403929983241226
but i think i may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer 	3.7151943722382406
i am not romantic you know 	4.256451435929356
" " that is very true , " replied elizabeth , " and i could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine 	3.49403582510366
they stood for some time without speaking a word 	3.3314090124107865
the conversation soon turned upon fishing , and she heard mr darcy invite him , with the greatest civility , to fish there as often as he chose , while he continued in the neighbourhood , offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle , and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport 	3.6885935450295255
it cannot last long 	4.234728252979039
the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment 	4.22156123267101
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party 	4.036736227398399
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her 	3.8780055712426615
london : printed for t 	2.8218322634246795
in as short a time as mr collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both 	4.100357816287452
for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me 	3.5962408084235205
" you may well warn me against such an evil 	3.048140696973234
a small sum could not do all this 	3.7219075271726267
in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation 	3.7568537647135654
i have more than once observed to lady catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her 	4.18428234435874
" well , well , and so mr bingley is coming down , sister , " ( for mrs philips first brought her the news 	3.4824532962290893
and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds 	3.7152829760565824
yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet 	3.8100356316103685
he comes down on thursday at the latest , very likely on wednesday 	4.581866109542196
it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately 	4.095071806069624
" " except , " thought elizabeth , " when she goes to ramsgate 	4.517040699258849
" " certainly , " replied elizabeth " there are such people , but i hope i am not one of them 	4.056390267340543
colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon 	3.5206211940520804
why was he to be the judge ? " " you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? " " i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy 	3.84859090787802
* * * * * mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother 	2.9253967053882666
as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters 	3.9692601808282015
to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth 	4.1047208173275616
elizabeth ' s courage did not fail her 	3.5249454283458426
such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song 	4.6988856537765225
my reasons for believing it are briefly these : it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable 	3.1814102678822036
and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last 	3.1882114932457783
her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening ' s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment 	3.8727763077892567
" it must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year 	3.5069781306701264
and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure 	3.6363025619297202
" you may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time 	3.412185020810384
mr darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together 	3.9582285211614234
but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own 	3.865683660201238
it was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing 	3.989501550917014
having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry 	3.877611268901528
it convinced her , that accident only could discover to mr bingley her sister ' s being in town 	3.65103178928675
at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner 	3.5675668558103864
i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday 	4.201231342364604
project gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify , do copyright research on , transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the project gutenberg tm collection 	4.1703452786216335
" " no , lizzy , that is what i do not choose 	4.526345127297119
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley 	3.4627130042457805
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information 	4.396178994027977
the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves 	3.364280399158561
they are all for what they can get 	4.090593535104119
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct 	3.3217205225620514
his character was to speak for itself 	3.6025297635301734
haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week 	5.3329466293762735
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine 	4.203942470040817
what could be more natural than his asking you again ? he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room 	3.2700299941159887
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere 	3.7780232601204355
i always said it must be so , at last 	3.738062085483966
did you see him while you were at lambton ? i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had 	3.529197004193984
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art 	3.8746402823983153
he was resolutely silent however 	3.745328461554529
he came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed 	5.0475762223228715
her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable 	4.074039308851426
" " not so hasty , if you please 	3.578171589000401
" i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her 	3.688096164273428
it amazes me , i confess 	4.652535710359301
nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair 	3.7116572154810354
" " and this is your real opinion ! this is your final resolve ! very well 	3.47611856656147
and he was obliged to walk about the room , while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences 	3.906795025479182
i write rather slowly 	4.194970265814432
the windows are full west 	4.201053637717912
" " aye , no doubt 	3.418858420019553
it was over at last however 	3.946265474357011
she has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever 	2.955530650730651
" i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir 	3.8524292018776105
our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia ' s character 	3.840080316845726
" " you have said quite enough , madam 	3.286661992139804
" " and what did she say ? " " that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well 	3.6939728370472387
they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank 	3.710286952565557
" " i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object 	3.710962481658242
" what does mr darcy mean , " said she to charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? " " that is a question which mr darcy only can answer 	3.7449501269911254
and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum 	3.1935633100165837
he was seriously concerned , that a cause of so little advantage to any one , should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law , and he was determined , if possible , to find out the extent of his assistance , and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could 	3.905552442168196
and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage 	3.591111753260683
i knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them 	3.581931589846382
not equal to lydia ' s for him 	5.217388471026659
did not i mention it to you ? mr robinson ' s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question oh ! the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point 	3.74893282860982
" " upon my word ! well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know 	3.068514968092192
she was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition 	3.8539699132404275
and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin 	3.5114889787591737
i knew you would be wishing me joy 	3.8077038263147474
is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ? a glass of wine 	4.135548031473601
but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley ' s inattention 	3.329288762646708
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy ' s marriage 	3.91227773931058
he really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger 	3.624844922382482
i have no such injuries to resent 	4.442646813578979
and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals 	3.7713631005793355
though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood 	4.602064594094252
nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly 	3.431727703171161
then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms 	4.256058123637441
" they were brightened by the exercise 	4.828174679671951
" i am astonished , " said miss bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books 	3.9824528209696926
i know no harm of her 	3.2621931464136456
on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer 	4.231826612543959
and then , on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured , he replied , " say nothing of that 	3.7705105972536344
thank heaven ! he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves 	3.4890161105082917
my mother means well 	4.061414565474198
and he and mr bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on 	3.854578827734587
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought , nor their offences against myself 	3.7150729977501715
i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude 	3.704177228868398
if you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase " project gutenberg " associated with or appearing on the work , you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs <num>	3.528855078927883
" i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town 	4.082277649862256
and though mrs philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley ' s good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar 	4.2025384815298965
good bye 	5.645326903105012
and every body began to find out , that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness 	3.8536235530228056
but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear 	4.4372835370445785
yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " you are mistaken , mr darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner 	3.7475715425489913
" i have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak 	3.461282915783202
by the author of " sense and sensibility 	1.9294170895082596
and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickham ' s attentions 	4.911032179705932
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time 	4.0398553870971226
but my feelings are not only cordial towards him 	3.3659395803822276
and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice 	2.9164498207434204
though i doubt whether his reserve , or anybody'_ reserve , can be answerable for the event 	3.7676007421371263
oh ! how acutely did she now feel it 	3.61654791130371
had the late mr darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better 	3.457478999152952
he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting 	3.8033796836870692
my temper would perhaps be called resentful 	3.660766697232981
we passed each other several times 	4.0020976354306645
" you certainly do , " she replied with a smile 	4.60778908052235
but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr collins ' s correspondence for any consideration 	3.7671268762983394
i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen 	4.121001694167865
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications 	3.737688906686486
in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence 	4.051045233382806
" come , darcy , " said he , " i must have you dance 	4.531992333422381
" " no why should he ? if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections , because i had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? " " but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event 	4.296117872629934
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickham ' s charge , exceedingly shocked her 	3.80089047485542
here you are in your own family 	4.749945685514886
they were hopeless of remedy 	3.8989958715962856
her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else 	3.375241585180085
though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration 	3.97802386107187
" " you persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him 	3.461178394208022
but she is too much like her brother , very , very proud 	3.8506514916651478
" " we will be down as soon as we can , " said jane 	4.10565624732094
her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire 	3.5783257078722395
but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess 	3.9010780794833604
no thanks to his gallantry for that 	4.119733474888498
was not a man to be trusted 	4.9962643184745925
and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr darcy 	4.070130173151143
i would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day 	4.500071722559729
the envelope itself was likewise full 	3.4961156143122363
" " money ! my uncle ! " cried jane , " what do you mean , sir ? " " i mean , that no man in his senses , would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life , and fifty after i am gone 	3.599513147839799
and covering her face with her handkerchief , elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else 	4.91546865583892
jane was by no means better 	4.143164604915463
" " i certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said darcy , " of conversing easily with those i have never seen before 	3.765336635709218
but she could not approve him 	4.239697936766672
the particulars , i reserve till we meet 	4.187979214200814
" " a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe 	3.242233262304722
and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again 	3.2169182458184564
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word 	3.9096368985056245
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane 	3.707785013853511
but the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me 	4.150273006019769
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks 	3.6638161134468255
" " i beg your pardon , " replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer 	3.656320959267419
daughters are never of so much consequence to a father 	4.373342530090327
jane listened with astonishment and concern 	4.033134049159631
" mr gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday 	4.037299318300122
in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great 	3.6610406314623583
lizzy declares she will not have mr collins , and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy 	4.634507637428577
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject 	3.7330485435932736
let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance 	3.695413995876025
" " i should like it beyond any thing ! " said her mother 	3.5415771929477127
a military life is not what i was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible 	3.6984309020194472
chapter xi 	3.5396391012611037
he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday 	4.11899488198252
" " how i long to see her again ! i never met with anybody who delighted me so much 	3.2058626046206276
" " very well 	3.114200086792274
she saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown 	4.810933729719655
it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them 	3.7578805817580623
for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained 	3.190231204863595
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings 	3.6464213114351396
but she is nothing to me now 	3.932598735727905
mr bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man 	3.7083808444799113
mr philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before 	3.604105422869035
" i do not know when i have been more shocked , " said she 	3.916304221161878
" " neglect ! i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place 	3.4744193694978596
not a word , however , passed his lips in allusion to it , till their visitor took his leave for the night 	3.711652873885503
but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence 	3.071375948802997
she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham 	3.890418489401555
sir william did not say much 	4.281172554840329
and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy 	3.735325910959982
" " i wish i might take this for a compliment 	3.3392478685607334
he bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy , with an expression of half laughing alarm 	4.065332095349873
" as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession 	4.5661155733465355
" " perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often 	3.696552720866307
her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious 	3.846113590784182

" louisa , you will not mind my waking mr hurst 	4.9784891930434165
he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement 	3.419402862095726
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being 	3.7711103483153408
" repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare 	5.1353596544916575
while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room 	3.8502341973456993
there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard 	4.253266275445943
and there was my aunt , all the time i was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon 	3.2843971357188333
we neither of us perform to strangers 	3.8066403808088056
" i knew , " said he , " that what i wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary 	4.297787089311556
" " lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now 	3.6377035360662484
well , but now for my news : it is about dear wickham 	3.8829081870371085
but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry 	4.1705706305687125
it was the last of the regiment ' s stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace 	3.6753447624288293
and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh , i think it will be very tolerable 	4.637914545966125
" " oh ! " cried miss bingley , " charles writes in the most careless way imaginable 	3.861296314726725
had she not seen him in derbyshire , she might have supposed him capable of coming there , with no other view than what was acknowledged 	3.659603690309172
and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side 	3.61384196015421
you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope , though you have but a short lease 	3.973317941167421
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his 	3.65476567691279
unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept 	4.34499926897061
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate 	4.09878914634932
" how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter ! " he made no answer 	3.0549611675591253
chapter xiv 	3.5396357525995215
and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies 	3.5329544513538744
how mr darcy looked , therefore , she could not tell 	4.8221943823777975
but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most 	3.3945513250279666
" " but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , " replied darcy 	3.710049999448196
was it so ? " " yes 	4.443847227648384
its completion depended on others 	3.7979036863649087
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents 	3.6655632447556745

and then you may say whatever you like of me 	3.2952534580121937
sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise 	4.244454053641522
how does georgiana get on , darcy ? " mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s proficiency 	4.027290639583454
mrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him 	3.8391886516561047
and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ? we cannot suppose he would help it , if he could 	3.3559388736728164
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all 	4.224078044201719
the situation of your mother ' s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father 	3.3688007253268424
" yet it is hard , " she sometimes thought , " that this poor man cannot come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation ! i will leave him to himself 	4.43194665721075
adding , with a significant smile , " i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here 	4.076070101490639
it is highly improper 	4.01730778928887
how could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister ' s attachment 	3.866333740149641
" " i beg your pardon 	2.3899374539546137
the carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it , by dinner time 	4.648048895621819
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained 	3.5302986208883183
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner , and too busy to know any thing about it , they found at last , on examining their watches , that it was time to be at home 	3.9784705783461263
to miss lydia bennet ,' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing 	3.935535100996866
she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne ' s 	4.320658315214617
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe 	3.8008502304416503
<num>	3.986380516691557
and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise 	3.7567072818589344
jane heard them with horror 	4.545806473538643
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an inmate of mr darcy ' s house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture 	4.3257199139572196
when the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist 	3.4847014166561157
had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? " as she pronounced these words , mr darcy changed colour 	3.910470125918916
" " and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , i suppose , of their being really married ? " " how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ! i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister ' s happiness with him in marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right 	3.9752942652951306
" " but i hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood 	3.1680503340623094
wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison 	3.9729043511224753
" she is happy , then , " said her father , drily 	4.108413488395044
" elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready acquiescence 	3.3586545140041784
" " an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth 	3.235947434593324
their powers of conversation were considerable 	4.057716399661398
mr bennet protested against any description of finery 	3.5075336403962694
i did not know before , that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony 	4.678884793274412
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together 	3.8893739887118164
but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant 	4.448283952189572
elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view 	3.217903241080446
" the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days 	3.4087423264795076
" " certainly 	3.893576487405851
so easy , that every servant will cheat you 	4.297746883545287
and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady ' s removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at clapham 	4.110960215380618
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it 	3.127445525322204
my aunt ' s intelligence had given me hope , and i was determined at once to know every thing 	4.099033381886228
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun 	4.308202480088419
with the gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms 	4.458012078841385

miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty , but she smiled too much 	4.038397062760695
darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure 	3.3733354815664827
he drew a chair near her 	4.135553814412983
he owed a good deal in the town , but his debts of honour were still more formidable 	3.9463349583051297
but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish 	3.686295333863247
and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , i shall not say nay to him 	3.4607837916973163
i should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire 	3.518730095672317
what could your ladyship propose by it ? " " at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted 	3.7225973770200147
lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her 	3.81596658607358
" he should be particularly happy at any time , &c 	3.543939696961634
and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend 	3.3838614794620954
" he paused in hopes of an answer 	3.4713300479111555
regard for my sister ' s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge 	4.53739887868236
their sister ' s wedding day arrived 	4.208045787613369
it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side 	3.72069947943736
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended 	3.4928138851306834
but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country 	3.4435550175056266
her mind was less difficult to develope 	4.340646729826924
he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce 	3.29623332431071
" " ten thousand pounds ! heaven forbid ! how is half such a sum to be repaid ? " mr bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house 	3.324653046422601
easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important 	4.159164876963074
" my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? " said her aunt 	4.450675325540403
and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected 	3.7072391226170778
chapter i 	3.5681501501050112
" your ' s , &c 	3.1039657706988533
mr collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family 	4.628924908973431
dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter , which , in her ladyship ' s apprehension , peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance , in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew , which she had refused to give 	3.7219371349797403
no , i certainly am not 	4.7506601344419686
" but of this answer lydia heard not a word 	3.417594968164832
you had much better dance 	4.466166037845798
and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing 	4.335329572680009
from the farther disadvantage of lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going 	3.782481905981528
or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour 	3.5008415039501264
his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing 	3.938372847195743
the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and lady catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging 	4.5581755575257406
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now 	4.282864296193391
her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables 	3.5753037986341285

mr collins ' s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs bennet 	3.4432008450112392
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter 	3.633593013456018

mr bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other 	3.944728005411867
" " and this , " cried darcy , as he walked with quick steps across the room , " is your opinion of me ! this is the estimation in which you hold me ! i thank you for explaining it so fully 	3.641383493087169
there is one point , on which i want your advice 	3.9123193287017473
" " that is as it happens 	3.3957063310227413
it was dated from rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows : " be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you 	3.532554431695978
say that urgent business calls us home immediately 	4.214865891481135
" that is rather singular 	4.588346620378569
on finding mrs bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? " before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , mrs bennet instantly answered , " oh dear ! yes certainly 	4.164824533351131
but on returning to the drawing room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her 	4.183694129871883
" " his pride , " said miss lucas , " does not offend me so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it 	4.022519051426917
pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary 	3.3443100403082635
i do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children 	3.5642753663414455
after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , mr collins attending them to point out its beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer 	3.5306988883199626

for she received an invitation from mrs forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton 	3.501359710769797
and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion 	3.693062523697777
it had better have happened to you , lizzy 	4.213269201790318
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired 	3.4287762983371697
" he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said 	3.5674206961143526
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it 	3.6687059444814007
of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant 	4.605655880613075
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family 	3.583318253059366
mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it 	3.6617062945592846
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor 	3.8793524182604084
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor 	3.4416860072244195
they solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister 	3.5190295743905247
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road 	3.7574303490693817
" elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply 	3.694493057934581
she declared her resolution 	4.961244806708209
and immediately , though not very fluently , gave him to understand , that her sentiments had undergone so material a change , since the period to which he alluded , as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure , his present assurances 	4.057017552487542
" mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham ' s removal from the shire , as clearly as mr gardiner could do 	3.4859903170947635
" they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas 	3.6530416816468527
but proud and conceited 	4.83967741203891
the good news quickly spread through the house 	3.756032772176606
till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her 	3.948093361715445
four weeks passed away , and jane saw nothing of him 	4.472514774092152
the younger ones out before the elder are married ! your younger sisters must be very young ? " " yes , my youngest is not sixteen 	3.574123221345446
" mr bingley arrived 	4.416404780270976
the business was therefore soon settled 	3.936818437367226
and mrs bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter 	3.75775754485683
he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter 	4.811792227962671
" is it not clear enough ? does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister 	3.484435519931724
their manner of living , even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home , was unsettled in the extreme 	3.3997032406998815
you are safe from me 	3.7957685177298988
" " this is a wretched beginning indeed ! my sole dependence was on you 	2.9223201907159257
" " oh ! yes , " said elizabeth drily " mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him 	3.5407256327199486
during dinner , mr bennet scarcely spoke at all 	4.864746731262565
" " this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer 	3.827399521934943
" he meant , i believe , " replied jane , " to go to epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them 	4.387497922523293
" she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door 	3.9420917926827137
her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself 	3.6139941647403533
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly 	3.7151054780977097
we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice 	3.5702985725643903
" " but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea 	4.022204648830578
miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth 	4.059993852266386
she dared not even mention that gentleman 	3.781973345402933
" i did not know that you intended to walk , " said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard 	3.9788727490294775
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia 	4.53625123549365
what made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? " " because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement 	3.5512155751135586
and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits 	4.606710858692428
she could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present 	3.925608478582438
he has children of his own , and may have more 	4.445973316451723
jane now came up 	4.63565534309074
mrs bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband ' s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income 	3.3654516080084727
but no such recollection befriended her 	3.557310489587554
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity 	3.796920627456147
i wish i could see her 	3.73299477926085
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible 	3.6864718333855118
i need not explain myself farther 	3.923439991397926
let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest 	3.900888963977223
to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures 	4.150340163535184
as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs bennet followed her , saying , " i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself 	3.7653345111751904
you never see a fault in any body 	4.09204969669292
i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again 	3.130255553571147
and the others were to meet us at the church 	3.9674003996619622
he still loves me , and we are engaged 	5.957730281068021
mr darcy looked up 	4.126911760764613
" we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said mrs gardiner , " but perhaps to the lakes 	3.8938205285785474
and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room 	3.540273680527246
" you used us abominably ill , " answered mrs hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out 	3.483372328342362
she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done 	4.290156414191639
her report was highly favourable 	4.307766900381628
" it is nothing in comparison of rosings , my lady , i dare say 	3.411966609356375
they are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain 	3.4558916011752716
and i am sure if i had been you , i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it 	3.9411874231360273
you shall not defend her , though it is charlotte lucas 	3.9845179868757366
though we can never be what we once were to each other 	3.706354861092775
it is enough to know they are discovered , i have seen them both " " then it is , as i always hoped , " cried jane 	4.0353961567985
and in the latter object , where she feared most to fail , she was most sure of success , for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour 	3.883209865915711
gardiner 	4.835894855258233
you will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that mr wickham ' s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be 	3.68235379349136
" and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr darcy 	4.609047028916015
mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required 	3.4581267286679145
" he then shut the door , and coming up to her , claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister 	4.187566397635198
she comes here to morrow with him 	3.7312734855636926
let me know every thing that i am to know , without delay 	4.67170910295391
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees 	4.351550948478202
they went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her 	4.277730945746022
" only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since i went away 	4.150484737024269
" she then spoke of the letter , repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham 	3.682354023648176
and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness 	3.9867547617184855
" i hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother in law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue 	3.5809274288692263
" " my dear sir , " replied mr collins , " i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship ' s concurrence 	3.5094180315216357
and continually was she repeating , " why is he so altered ? from what can it proceed ? it cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened 	3.564168423276789
an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton 	3.4302084515316804
he was not seated by her 	3.839808951030413
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him 	3.336499113295615
and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been 	4.139802504606781
their first subject was her sister 	3.444973781032775
and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered 	4.552083941370425
he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself 	3.84921450589301
accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer 	4.115171426979827
" a long dispute followed this declaration 	3.9081102736181976
women fancy admiration means more than it does 	4.38323923849883
my dear , dear lydia ! how merry we shall be together when we meet ! " her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardiner ' s behaviour laid them all under 	3.703778907239705
when all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at pemberley 	3.976708960630702
younger sons cannot marry where they like 	4.474557214533668
nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation 	3.2476687394461976
" and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes 	3.97901551836936
if it be not so , let mr darcy contradict it 	3.6178809414044655
but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him 	3.8955631419793297
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity 	4.003859582193367
you may depend upon my seeking no further 	3.0975411432607127
" you look pale 	4.389721783871613
the first week of their return was soon gone 	3.598293155884081
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife 	3.7430808182951045
for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him 	3.698806363432676
i expected you to stay two months 	3.4066712012657656
but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know 	3.720214650264916
" what a charming amusement for young people this is , mr darcy ! there is nothing like dancing after all 	3.8821243362460014
i never heard any harm of her 	2.8447814971565615
mrs collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home 	3.7981419409608392
i cannot find out that i hate her at all , or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl 	3.8299739194224984
" could i expect it to be otherwise ! " said she 	4.520081382514117
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow 	4.1810374384598
and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part 	3.7030822189128814
on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo , and was immediately invited to join them 	4.69285090554406
and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice 	4.444856859966637
they may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose 	4.557005661812464
" you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age 	3.770001830688279
at length , she spoke again 	3.8272321639890494
special rules , set forth in the general terms of use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing project gutenberg tm electronic works to protect the project gutenberg tm concept and trademark 	3.41497159484259
" they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea 	4.012765036856233
she blushed , and jane blushed 	4.607283743945316
" read it aloud , " said their father , " for i hardly know myself what it is about 	5.131541781885526
their other aunt also visited them frequently , and always , as she said , with the design of cheering and heartening them up , though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham ' s extravagance or irregularity , she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them 	3.810436605112779
and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be 	3.608964452013003
mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday 	3.5664309933355405
and as she considered that jane ' s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations , and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct , she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before 	3.1099773678930327
" not at all 	3.9199637068801496
" during their walk , it was resolved that mr bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening 	3.85891875685793
he will immediately comprehend what i must feel , and i rely upon his goodness 	4.159780827322461
the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him 	4.237083672272794
he replied , and was again silent 	6.344518317176702
" oh , lizzy ! it cannot be 	4.33224801558764
what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go 	3.8063479097116084
" " compared with some families , i believe we were 	4.13797610949532
he meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it 	5.214081946744341
" good gracious ! " cried maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! " " a great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh 	3.8624957486985876
at least , you should not remind your mother of inviting him 	3.5630161228532566
and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick 	4.222590885499967
" " complied with ! i am only ashamed of his asking so little 	3.8604539499071415
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out 	3.977014323230397
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself 	3.199241967180108
" her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano forte was opened , and darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it 	3.87971938870888
and at length , by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match 	3.8595099434505555
but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle 	3.962229900618521
for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot 	3.5921980074168522
" from what we have seen of him , " continued mrs gardiner , " i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham 	4.138216634812502
" " have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? " " oh ! yes 	2.998226269994725
as for jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than elizabeth ' s 	3.8285965024807065
and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day 	3.0431262924802387
" " you are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment 	3.9838635688827195
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste 	3.3461855393925255
" lady catherine seemed pleased 	3.6600956240163507
to own the truth , with wickham ! imagine our surprise 	3.90574470384569
" " indeed you are mistaken 	3.7206956008599823
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable 	3.4948125050615784
" you forget that i have made no answer 	3.8894524646976616
they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , every thing to him 	4.247751706318328
when this was done , she had a less active part to play 	4.31545231054604
" " is he married or single ? " " oh ! single , my dear , to be sure ! a single man of large fortune 	3.5810367373530045
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham 	3.4954883541560826
so easily guided that his worth was invaluable 	4.306610140007237
the miss webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your ' s 	3.9009482758024157
" " lady catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour 	4.0713750744898425
miss bennet ' s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural 	3.3937120323728576
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn 	4.089430587216902
and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts 	4.374994325986637
and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage 	3.825914562392626
i am prodigiously proud of him 	3.313090226318883
the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl 	3.4838178369076758
but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment 	3.5180084513616277
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable 	6.047397802210287
that it should be equally unreserved was impossible 	3.92738281634026
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball 	3.7057324147442294
it is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , i hope you will think of us 	3.7839029346584665
on this subject , what can you have to say ? in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? " " you take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns , " said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour 	3.6638841961769244
but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular 	3.470425204926497
he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia once 	4.246796467743772
she has never been taught to think on serious subjects 	3.3620783716496185
but as i have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now 	3.7646442030298863
wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued 	4.5373942123180635
for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce 	3.9471106288730184
she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage 	4.482385659076641
elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her 	3.6356313083791347
the part which i acted , is now to be explained 	3.9447396226934366
" she is so fond of mrs forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away ! and there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much 	3.765416623002795
there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which i do not reflect with satisfaction 	4.047213962351049
" " not that i shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter 	4.560343045134855
as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence 	4.1255313754266725
he introduced us to his sister 	4.187737236575427
i am so grieved for him 	3.408076695642421
human nature is so prone to fall into it ! no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame 	4.962835852020581
" " my dear lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now 	3.8059898161718198
allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , miss bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety 	3.682970810646309
their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast room 	4.249249609876262
" nay , " said elizabeth , " this is not fair 	4.764526492575041
when the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one 	4.170416321068455
i was never more annoyed ! the insipidity and yet the noise 	4.0046146593572
it was lady catherine de bourgh 	3.6982865533676748
she is all affability and condescension , and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over 	4.069811661771999
and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary 	3.6653316548365784
and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him 	4.430935898496493
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her 	4.88130422309795
" with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content 	3.890064110837067
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine ' s visit 	3.9776743996426807
" oh ! yes i understand you perfectly 	3.29867254438208
" he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group 	3.607403317556503
but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected 	3.7597027115918094
his surprise was great 	4.343051262572331
and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much 	3.698480982026555
i see the imprudence of it 	3.9306984769362243
to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr robinson 	3.18535685364928
" can you come to morrow ? " yes , he had no engagement at all for to morrow 	4.14189339682423
" but , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here 	3.7433565940819746
by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain 	3.2671599871459587
" most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote 	3.8365700302538865
his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk 	3.8950826957805367
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice 	4.128954589574036
" " i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one 	3.545688106412144
good gracious ! when i went away , i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again ! though i thought it would be very good fun if i was 	3.8614571137005336
but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness 	3.4996497543265206
a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself 	3.7416912135041103
but at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey 	4.198980905280445
we will go round the park every day 	3.705762547940396
if i may so express it , he has a right to be proud 	4.441985559033845
" can it be possible that he will marry her ? " " wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him 	4.249864938669466
there was another reason too for her opposition 	3.763316929913037
and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances 	3.904355295407419
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man , and talked very pleasantly 	4.2300801860955834
to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men 	4.484461989389226
and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required 	3.269295727012102
as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire 	3.4390450234381063
i will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as i can , or , perhaps , i may defer it , till kitty runs away 	3.9530056078646454
" to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew 	3.4165255139277337
" elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could 	3.426619931852283
they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight 	3.5760164358319178
[ illustration : morning dress 	3.380070900423356
after sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to elizabeth , " i hope you are well , miss bennet 	4.807799700287776
" " all ! what , all five out at once ? very odd ! and you only the second 	3.1707961160289266
we may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon 	3.7441306007462987
she sees them now very often standing in clarke ' s library 	4.047920378519266
mrs bennet said only , " nonsense , nonsense ! " " what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? " cried he 	3.975172011985094
" elizabeth was forced to go 	3.2331181563722824
nothing of the past was recollected with pain 	4.14462674737513
it told them , that on his arrival , he had immediately found out his brother , and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street 	4.28200437945286
she had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means 	3.9933233536617716
and in the nearness of the parsonage , or the pleasantness of the walk to it , or of the people who lived in it , the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day 	3.7973742032957136
darcy , after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing 	3.7541478216010504
that he is to take possession before michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week 	4.671778328669787
but that gentleman , " looking at darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all 	3.6480131592959273
mr darcy ' s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister ' s sufferings 	3.9639860450309983
but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self importance , and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeth ' s mind 	3.3629940563733034
" she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter 	3.762365934673284
he arranges the business just as he pleases 	3.5459333415974155
" elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement 	3.794044209643781
mrs bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia ' s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book 	4.125457346297131
" this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities 	4.092636225344572
contributions to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by u 	3.629476022243668
when she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation 	3.7726431310956614
for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing 	3.6154424839120853
" elizabeth made no answer 	2.318513523547789
and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home 	3.653503410117016
a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age 	4.066935840243157
and her mother , with manners so far from right herself , was entirely insensible of the evil 	3.553568401684276
the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off 	4.162337715736898
and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than politeness 	3.9306327643854524
a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification 	4.17285577067276
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton 	3.443254215323871
what a stroke was this for poor jane ! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind , as was here collected in one individual 	3.4517635653698755
when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister 	4.4297443929247935
that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs forster called her , and they were going to the camp 	4.5119897374554006
we are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world 	3.847383845304509
<num>	3.986380516691557
it was a journey of only twenty four miles , and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon 	3.778826943417031
and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room 	3.4353622103249366
elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them 	3.5334070275379648
the children have been wanting me this half hour 	3.312619628089872
" " undoubtedly 	3.5065363980363293
mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight 	3.202045555650623
kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon 	3.777864816369368
but only because her husband ' s regiment happens to be so far off 	4.327297819399443
and her features are not at all handsome 	3.9170463549145125
assistance is impossible 	5.746210094440191
those who do not complain are never pitied 	3.7844357406087834
such a countenance , such manners ! and so extremely accomplished for her age ! her performance on the piano forte is exquisite 	3.2771549172336334
" if i , " said mr collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air 	4.205221214639912
mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day 	3.4181177404875394
but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance 	4.052252124671341
he found her as handsome as she had been last year 	4.741915415918895
" " my manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally i assure you 	3.9125501164715155
she said no more , and they went down the other dance and parted in silence 	4.172425019997409
she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother 	5.862147277879219
who instantly taking the alarm , set off from b 	3.6572218006103596
" then , who taught you ? who attended to you ? without a governess you must have been neglected 	3.5907353828469426
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt 	4.428016572106478
elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit , but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it 	3.996440471168229
and it was settled , that as soon as the ceremony was over , they should proceed to longbourn 	3.814949727568177
elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well 	3.7526990660412602
chapter ii 	3.5373847533145772
" then turning to mr bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon 	3.979365335997985
darcy was delighted with their engagement 	4.222602768584394
" " laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion 	3.8820084756783726
send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly 	3.884463476402434
and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , i will take it on myself 	3.972966691566423
the business of her life was to get her daughters married 	3.9751879072626655
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy 	4.411588412249488
she is not such a simpleton 	4.163862152007452
and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " do not make yourself uneasy , my love 	3.085318281193742
and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err 	3.7227839975070656
but he saw only the father 	3.990531668956436
and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world 	4.097012653407973
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was 	3.6204557594582143
respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever 	4.384943409985349
he never saw him till the other morning at meryton 	3.631393183519948
but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at 	3.549599275874851
when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room 	3.240727352587663
chapter xx 	2.9674598914339794
and will probably be much talked of 	3.8810298292677228
" " i know you do 	4.0688176707100405
" books oh ! no 	4.340776713487114
" " you need not distress yourself 	3.476677035373747
when they ascended the steps to the hall , maria ' s alarm was every moment increasing , and even sir william did not look perfectly calm 	3.1925348531949265
" jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern 	3.120761582703565
untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless 	4.146934428919497
just enough to make one good sort of man 	4.548692238844684
by tea time however the dose had been enough , and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies 	4.0279371933514545
he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her 	4.3899437817657105
" well , lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ? well , well , i only hope it will last 	3.7214188158821515
with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round 	4.989747395112203
" then , after a short silence , he continued , " lizzy , i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind 	3.359274438975337
she longed to speak , but could think of nothing to say 	3.910827705882792
" " which do you mean ? " and turning round , he looked for a moment at elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " she is tolerable 	4.001233654788297
" i have no reason , i assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception 	3.618374962244068
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s ear 	3.510654443268753
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable 	3.738994032487916
it was evident that he was very much in love with her 	3.615519804969163
the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people ! what would i give to hear your strictures on them ! " " your conjecture is totally wrong , i assure you 	3.3312253597978057
he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again 	4.427439233121517
and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her 	4.028261747321609
and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me 	3.487169358628889
the officers will find women better worth their notice 	3.366208211440824
" " yes , " replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but that was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance 	3.8951768012254484
" " caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter 	3.4543097522404276
" " yes , very well 	2.808225417650038
my poor father ! how he must have felt it ! " " i never saw any one so shocked 	3.7349912856804015
" i know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but i shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life " mrs philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason 	3.7173916297841862
" " if your master would marry , you might see more of him 	3.3571995494637314
and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with , though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire , and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house , and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh 	4.059649392426183
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves 	3.900022297184827
i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother 	4.396206395038906
no principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy 	4.174805878647481
whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ' s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded 	4.145696264672684
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself 	3.777101260802871
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter 	3.592934108251979
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain 	4.180032126709763
i told my sister philips so the other day 	4.030520481770252
" i do , indeed , " replied elizabeth , colouring 	3.9121328994998823
sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before 	3.711033107517874
he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister 	4.01723221071135
the officer was the very mr denny , concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire , and he bowed as they passed 	3.621543474613742
see paragraph <num>	3.9069474434092553
while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians 	3.336637409107335
there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs philips ' s supper party , but his manners recommended him to every body 	4.227605766308427
consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy 	4.79883417875096
and as dawson does not object to the barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , i should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large 	4.340983592720929
upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward 	5.2227074773488225
i take up my pen again to do , what i have just told you i would not , but circumstances are such , that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible 	4.25810421646807
only three miles 	5.0738268191938705
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " mr darcy , i am a very selfish creature 	4.613371333569884
" yes , ma'am , that he was indeed 	5.252630223470555
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling 	3.4533421337331136
" i am by no means of opinion , i assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency 	3.218623165008612
i cannot acquit him of that duty 	4.162579163912052
is it true ? " elizabeth replied that it was 	4.87971199454317
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball 	3.578482672439855
" " oh ! certainly , " said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity 	4.012978793110799
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight 	3.419103694334938
but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class 	3.508552594718903
" e 	5.899444848088516
to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not 	3.5842190554887754
i promised them so faithfully ! what will wickham say ? it was to be such a secret ! " " if it was to be secret , " said jane , " say not another word on the subject 	4.3464120004088285
her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms 	4.406131744322748
anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn 	4.980108504369565
" elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying 	3.5979115201148217
i hope there was 	4.372309481970422
that the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny 	4.1032631404747875
whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief 	4.065336325281867
" indeed , you are mistaken , madam 	4.397433398065375
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit 	3.514694464872733
" how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr darcy , " she cried 	3.93673112327678
and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ? did she call to refuse her consent ? " to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh 	3.46390545587321
chapter iii 	3.5373914463628107
the evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of jane and elizabeth 	3.57254106172686
the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres 	4.614937843608545
and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , i am sure , to oblige us for one half hour 	3.404553746601344
arguments are too much like disputes 	4.953051431408852
but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger 	3.7530906753416238
they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself 	4.9771420460085425
" " you have a very small park here , " returned lady catherine after a short silence 	3.00398948533726
" in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " i take no leave of you , miss bennet 	3.920116384466464
miss bennet ' s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority 	3.2777313289499355
i have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude 	4.282059963399707
and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room 	3.829789547513035
" " i dare say you believed it 	3.550090959410479
her face is too thin 	4.480549707016899
chapter ii 	3.5373847533145772
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness 	3.7093655840553676
in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise , and where he was reduced to meet , frequently meet , reason with , persuade , and finally bribe , the man whom he always most wished to avoid , and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce 	3.770221313873192
and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter 	3.9483802546936744
" you began the evening well , charlotte , " said mrs bennet with civil self command to miss lucas 	3.6231501730346674
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention 	3.3315303223255155
by the author of " sense and sensibility 	1.9294170895082596
and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem 	4.005761895805682
elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances 	4.93987018956338
and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and mrs long 	3.9630226629889638
she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it 	4.240288029535976
and she parted from him convinced , that whether married or single , he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing 	3.8322620969297545
mr collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him 	3.7278358437499683
i have suspected it some time , but i am now convinced 	4.489190576391387
mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public 	3.7775297184092493
his regard for her was quite imaginary 	4.357167018878073
" " oh ! my dear brother , " replied mrs bennet , " that is exactly what i could most wish for 	3.4150522280891766
in another minute mr bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend 	3.944954680031754
and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself 	3.2129065485950306
the first part of mrs gardiner ' s business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions 	3.476379593935458
" wickham , perhaps , is my favourite 	4.079848076580377
when we met at pemberley 	4.116522743199289
but slyness seems the fashion 	3.741885458979145
i do not believe she often sees such at home 	3.0637251716756806

mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane 	3.5521442008434545
chapter xix 	3.5396391012611037
they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house 	3.590299869370356
oh ! that abominable mr darcy ! my father ' s opinion of me does me the greatest honour 	3.7964687816154075
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds 	5.704448245827626
assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt 	3.6809028299224336
this cannot be ! engaged to mr darcy ! no , no , you shall not deceive me 	4.093505468398644
elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly 	4.413585628326895
and their mother talked on , of her dislike of mr darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them 	3.8690749101839965
" and her residence there will probably be of some duration 	3.6943566122401563
i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman 	4.46828712293626
" " no , nothing at all 	2.912007475420593
unless a copyright notice is included 	4.017728743669781
i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes 	3.7424284228821585
and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that , allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements , new carriages and wedding clothes , she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield , in the course of three or four months 	3.551382510205348
it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! another day i will do the same 	3.377220851624608
mr bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene 	3.6886383194505163
and mrs bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived 	3.775758447639187
elizabeth merely curtseyed to him , without saying a word 	3.9489045953836057
miss bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps 	4.12296992411908
" " i am sure i shall break mine , " said lydia 	3.8535580748180664
for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner 	3.7494298948696887
but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging 	4.188274330241262
but while they were supported by their mother ' s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? catherine , weak spirited , irritable , and completely under lydia ' s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice 	3.8729530649955435
" " i do not cough for my own amusement , " replied kitty fretfully 	4.407391847554946
the strangeness of mr collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted 	3.407589014506518
the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention 	3.9576102504789423
" she replied in the affirmative 	4.090860813119986
" " yes 	2.5913572305001953
and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too 	4.1536693994498295
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places 	3.9794977347241987
you have no compassion on my poor nerves 	3.5365201500077963
i will put on my things in a moment 	3.5313109287012816
" of music ! then pray speak aloud 	3.5361175119960517
but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame 	3.8111399273317086
it had come with a fare from london 	4.894626138046169
miss darcy ' s praise occupied the chief of it 	4.085377803042593
" " i hope not so 	3.4411018941771117
miss bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley 	3.13373705628912
chapter xiv 	3.5396357525995215
and very lively hopes of mr bingley ' s heart were entertained 	4.153231462923076
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia , and , removed from the influence of lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid 	3.441738126210887
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other 	3.9431580183909136
and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room 	3.8551969127358636
" " i can easily believe it 	3.295534715409586
" " he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship , " replied elizabeth with emphasis , " and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life 	4.473580315569602
laws alone swamp our small staff 	4.666809136656964
well , colonel fitzwilliam , what do i play next ? my fingers wait your orders 	3.4604722326207833
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country 	3.5910667669609215
" " i cannot pretend to be sorry , " said wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts 	4.163803787941817
but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year 	3.6250164831976353
and then added , " may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mrs collins well 	3.673824334233585
and with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former were excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment ' s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn 	3.876081633860323
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life 	3.9042597098012606
i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn 	3.456409596343853
i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you 	3.35409449119899
" it is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country 	3.8810057347987845
" but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there 	3.7298189352197206
" " i have already told her so once , by your desire 	3.4042129711792386
my father , however , is partial to mr wickham 	4.756690726060309
not one party , or scheme , or any thing 	3.844814851960274
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , mr bennet coolly observed , " from all that i can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country 	4.250731607770576
" i began to be afraid you would never come back again 	3.5250437413583264

in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger 	4.163769513899266
he begged pardon for having displeased her 	3.640234426216572
at present i am not in love with mr wickham 	4.424375691567121
the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself 	3.4525314664278977
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? if they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us 	3.5129168810627913
mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces , and the two eldest , from their recent absence , were particularly welcome , and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home , which , as their own carriage had not fetched them , she should have known nothing about , if she had not happened to see mr jones ' s shop boy in the street , who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away , when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by jane ' s introduction of him 	3.8557229580095567
and when it closed , elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well 	4.142867024590663
he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend 	3.4013187040660697
but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right 	3.529903248618747
jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare 	4.082897131806356
i suppose you have heard of it 	3.5825722228441013
" elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required 	4.222431253994314
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , i am sure 	3.59527839195503
and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there 	3.4703356071422657
but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london 	3.6007278288439055
but the grounds are delightful 	3.8418152814133104
and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted , which , in her anxious interpretation , denoted a recollection of jane , not untinctured by tenderness , and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her , had he dared 	4.570331317602397
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her 	3.766282559934946
and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte ' s dying an old maid 	3.2400348310577933
but he eluded the skill of them all 	3.8880419305430935
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side 	4.0170480117654215
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament 	4.749763930648728
till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk , she made some slight observation on the dance 	3.420123403995287
mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world 	3.6991807105777013
every disposition of the ground was good 	4.236635069556177
" " no , i thank you 	2.8923212831622167
into one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance 	4.085581083597288
" she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted 	4.163134388769886
her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it 	3.2571765020394174
bingley was punctual to his appointment 	5.0803961699777584
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power 	3.8883155368119744
this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem 	4.353695476004386
yours ever , " caroline bingley 	4.59954677578718
<num>	3.986380516691557
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe 	3.9378954184258244
" elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning 	3.52848419379772
elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation 	4.068233902518555
mrs wickham ! how well it sounds 	4.509008702027232
and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet 	3.2286668916227352
for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them 	3.479610003308144
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow 	3.442430824218682
all that his library afforded 	4.143868076458351
every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to charlotte ' s first sketch 	4.6151873626862345
" " how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year ! letters of business too ! how odious i should think them ! " " it is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours 	3.473381055025068
" " my dear , " replied her husband , " i have two small favours to request 	4.203201958163497
there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her , and though by no means so clever as herself , she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her ' s , he might become a very agreeable companion 	4.007960910045204
" " speak to lizzy about it yourself 	3.590449449141908
it was more than civil 	4.273878011750767
in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on 	3.4180360068812927
how is such a man to be worked on ? how are they even to be discovered ? i have not the smallest hope 	3.513704659061324
" about a month ago i received this letter , and about a fortnight ago i answered it , for i thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention 	3.7116463937195308
mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton 	3.3904157280596934
she enquired into charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all 	3.5490086933803346
and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others 	3.412095792119515
they will ruin your happiness 	3.5750413939380254
" this was a sad omen of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be 	3.7060751087688217
and , if i may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses 	3.186668491240362
never mind miss lizzy ' s hair 	3.9667201089286905
and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed 	4.298679424986529
" do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? i cannot quite agree with you there 	4.282634177852581
" that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance 	3.6221530559414203
" " i mention it , because it is the living which i ought to have had 	3.9300755413948747
and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable , and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate , will be kindly overlooked on your side , and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch 	3.3533828635915537
" and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together 	3.7752499848793
my father was not only fond of this young man ' s society , whose manners were always engaging 	3.388977078856232
but with a moment ' s recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often 	3.675904115705391
when at length they arose to take leave , mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn 	3.6633224156384165
in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained 	3.8442551972428003
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day 	3.3018923144507895
her carriage remained at the door , and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it 	4.0715336335186825
and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her 	3.3127051263473386
yes , i call it a very easy distance 	4.08998403389689
had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt , to my own family ! had his character been known , this could not have happened 	3.5738033184835736
but her letters were always long expected , and always very short 	3.611875455578352
" chapter iv 	3.1640529933237764
he had looked at her without admiration at the ball 	3.911086980745665
" i did not think caroline in spirits , " were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london 	4.513915982883141
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you 	4.263516095452911
and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card table , and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game 	3.3354040918749908
no one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection 	3.467639962893934
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both 	3.143724569923067
wickham will soon be gone 	4.269519415372142
" with my mother up stairs 	3.815392140996494
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic 	3.7028413458701905
and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see 	3.7441948398298184
but i can guess how it was 	4.000526929296597
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly 	3.938772879466248
but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least 	3.929478455436225
and elizabeth found , that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection , and secure of her relations' consent , there was still something to be wished for 	4.1572787054844005
she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents 	3.571116143415596
" and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well 	3.307280364390442
you have delighted us long enough 	3.6604548115018867
they found mr bennet still up 	3.9574795015325455
they all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses 	4.951915100006845
they insist also on my seeing mr jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and head ache there is not much the matter with me 	3.760525660629757
i am glad of one thing , that he comes alone 	4.7365325011934845
in spite of having been at st 	4.084313801826866
" " i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more 	3.081108847312591
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy 	3.8074134056786675
and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due 	4.068300021799153
" this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make 	3.827352626943641
while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them 	3.426547862663114
" she looks sickly and cross 	3.6962559436815563
i can recal nothing worse 	4.519302534194993
but , really , i know not what to say 	4.156536204037111
and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation 	3.955781558389691
for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him , i should only think worse of her understanding , than i now do of her heart 	3.83828826040654
" her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital 	3.7124317649034007
she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked 	4.301156873951612
" the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other 	3.7245601444387586
came on into hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in barnet and hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through 	5.444143639380359
please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses 	5.899986637151806
it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate 	3.369453268915611
" what do you mean , mr bennet , by talking in this way ? you promised me to insist upon her marrying him 	3.0879833103697845
" i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning 	4.288141620851967
after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : " you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it 	3.600760132021358
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door 	4.005204512278717
" my dear , dear aunt , " she rapturously cried , " what delight ! what felicity ! you give me fresh life and vigour 	3.815713166115644
" * * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday 	3.1729603228144074
were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain 	3.770136189078664
i am very glad you liked her 	3.429864607236004
" " shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine , what is to befall her ? " " i am more likely to want time than courage , elizabeth 	3.746332308161977
and so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ? their manners are not equal to his 	3.51154157724328
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation 	3.4401224132030976
" your affectionate friend , " lydia bennet 	4.24383174785216
" " this is the only point , i flatter myself , on which we do not agree 	3.8447721067474507
and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged 	3.992122274110165
my dear hill , have you heard the good news ? miss lydia is going to be married 	3.5002758107898777
" and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly 	4.163754729031002
" " i wish it may 	3.3255043207413837
but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did , for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment , had they sat in one equally lively 	3.504444896525506
chapter xii 	2.9674598914339794
he had never had the slightest suspicion 	3.8353248006757545
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex 	3.4895297808805035
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself 	4.035003651014792
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected 	2.8904338333877817
do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent 	3.999620370152821
" elizabeth quietly answered " undoubtedly 	3.4684878154128262
i told you so from the first , you may remember 	4.5673624828872414
it was not in their direct road , nor more than a mile or two out of it 	3.2328066475223944
" but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte ' s wishes , to be the case 	4.105634994727037
and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit 	4.521914868143223
" " thank you , " said lydia , " for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry 	4.576831862232092
that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match 	4.770355953642114
and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills 	3.156946506892924
and , before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out 	3.5715358128562213
" i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man ' s intimates in the regiment , whether wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself 	3.834180579101404
" " oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! " " perhaps it would have been better 	3.6313031161924143
but now it was all too natural 	4.230666066381086
" " indeed i do not dare 	4.180907443351574
having said thus much , i feel no doubt of your secrecy 	4.31606057077556
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers 	4.330798066261321
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter ' s lips instead of your own 	3.409050567421421
but in general charlotte wisely did not hear 	3.459612991193978
" " ah ! you do not know what i suffer 	3.729665956441199
she was going to the butcher ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed 	4.376600157796984
poor charlotte ! it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! but she had chosen it with her eyes open 	3.955185490916093
they were in fact very fine ladies 	3.595191112544617
we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough 	3.5027886067081195
and elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages 	4.061988439666252
to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success 	3.6845730062762865
" " i had much rather go in the coach 	3.069541405916567
they now walked on in silence 	4.310481739005331
" mrs bennet , in short , was in very great spirits 	4.092648212471963
<num>	3.986380516691557
" " an easy distance do you call it ? it is nearly fifty miles 	3.258435025643845
she had turned away , but on hearing herself called , though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy , she moved again towards the gate 	3.9064098604767494
it had been written five days ago 	3.4976621034448963
only think of that my dear 	5.1628659869532285
i thought it would never be over 	4.140179341792667
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after 	3.968245179731536
" and they are really to be married ! " cried elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves 	4.182640603560839
<num>	3.986380516691557
he has heartily forgiven me now 	3.7434002291184187
what it contains , has surprised me a good deal 	4.827603211033146
and already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all 	4.29919217644015
mrs bennet ' s best comfort was , that mr bingley must be down again in the summer 	3.4563750918286407
" in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned 	4.277790982021292
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night 	3.338818455942959
his principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham 	3.921002691181002
" " i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself 	3.2388851969781602
but this would be nothing if you really liked him 	3.6087306011335336
but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine 	3.884497021911112
if elizabeth , when mr darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents 	4.116042653542504
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in 	3.4427521474742773
it was not their wish to force her communication 	3.2722669482639706
and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite 	3.608840957272206
elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ' s thoughts , now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away 	3.288776420115379
if , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your ' s , i can only say that i am sorry 	4.591076119303308
elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane ' s being in the fairest way for happiness 	4.678566688132784
his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased 	4.244482626459304
" jane then took it from her pocket book , and gave it to elizabeth 	3.670759023951708
nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family 	3.691596422131248
chapter iii 	3.5373914463628107
" you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! unfeeling , selfish girl ! do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? " " lady catherine , i have nothing farther to say 	4.109787502604208
we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon 	4.890449643809883
mr bingley had not been of age two years , when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house 	3.6854768205371267
i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : i like them prodigiously 	3.4494388164590966
" " do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " " it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it 	3.7726775957032217
we have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve 	3.864400635929541
how wonderfully these sort of things occur ! who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly ! i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before 	3.303569459734052
let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions 	3.8917871485539113
and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather 	3.5096636482709576
and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself 	3.7800938599392957
he was my godfather , and excessively attached to me 	4.393978202436412
elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome 	3.5153889582709357
and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light 	3.7163177804860164
and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible 	3.753138560209282
elizabeth jumped out 	4.796970512497659
lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed 	3.8395022692831744
it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ' s being in town 	3.455991898266458
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home 	3.772397395705996
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance 	3.3764390388411702
but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded 	4.2402564433171355
kitty stared at him , and lydia exclaimed 	5.187682581933203
his pride never deserts him 	4.097723089514699
) " well , so much the better 	4.242096145017429
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt 	3.986976669919434
" she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word 	3.763299317309146
the moral will be perfectly fair 	4.1523163230816955
mrs gardiner , who was several years younger than mrs bennet and mrs philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces 	4.095253643212133
" she then sat still five minutes longer 	3.293260956632898
" but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine 	3.5039587465419015
" " miss bennet , do you know who i am ? i have not been accustomed to such language as this 	3.820513395540121
" " no , " said her father , " wickham ' s a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds 	4.283492187862014
he was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey 	3.32709861480567
on mr and mrs gardiner ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment 	3.7962006789123
and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce 	3.9114600377210955
for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire , and of his being gone into the regulars 	3.7094555311243465
i certainly have had my share of beauty , but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now 	4.221205946427219
he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia 	4.767643280460632
my visit was not long , as caroline and mrs hurst were going out 	4.1183944174533975
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other 	4.597094046492191
kitty was too much afraid of him to talk 	5.306556414552912
" " no , that i am sure i shall not 	3.9332012411804946
" mr wickham ' s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ' s 	3.3239086530620052
contact the foundation as set forth in section <num> below 	3.6746239259742586
and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them 	4.115464399886983
but she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents 	3.3696775710874394
what relates to yourself , is as follows 	3.5604843613861137
but their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them 	4.381981441392949
the rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side , of usual cheerfulness , but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth 	3.9556087947347955
which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts 	4.113665312180399
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own 	3.9123488137505906
" " if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it 	4.230185823642739
and mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment 	3.542451796214998
she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself 	3.6401040360339496
is not it so , mrs bennet ? " " yes , or i will never see her again 	4.254944490265126
his coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and i wonder how he could presume to do it 	4.389321650467424
" " but , my dear , your father cannot spare the horses , i am sure 	3.086116060914512
" and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother ? " said mr gardiner 	4.8038732095245775
" my father and maria are to come to me in march , " added charlotte , " and i hope you will consent to be of the party 	4.5134177036264145
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants 	4.0995113004285955
you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me 	3.9374856744284017
teaze him laugh at him 	4.542204100382465
" " i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him , i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this ! " after a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " i do remember his boasting one day , at netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper 	4.012015647795462
and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way 	3.172718918948112
and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning 	4.124137750831843
will you come and see me ? " " we shall often meet , i hope , in hertfordshire 	4.177011952249455
by supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy 	3.418408733365659
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used 	3.825254870607049
they must all go to brighton 	4.070083868738653
he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence 	4.726148502435353
most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education 	4.07408127607164
who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! " " she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind 	4.139261083805052
that was impossible 	5.17389398947835
well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better 	3.848215780661717
but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal 	4.388999088690204
but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility 	3.964154192237722
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did 	4.121117299084639
and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy 	3.687187306154363
his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes 	3.651655346376026
while she spoke , an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion , earnestly looking at her , and his sister overcome with confusion , and unable to lift up her eyes 	3.2722401366500065
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure 	3.886309034554014
" " if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there 	3.482952628580379
she had instinctively turned away 	4.1385068876700934
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well 	5.132459985140295
and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , mr gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power 	3.397612635707155
its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines , crowded with the young and the gay , and dazzling with scarlet 	5.221957430120435
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham 	3.4445364371577547
but this is the true one 	4.542398001764211
his doing so drew her notice 	3.787961109907489
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower 	3.7775669844540993
" " lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use 	4.314906356105666
my aunt told me so herself on saturday 	3.7029681714034206
" we may as well leave them by themselves you know 	3.669055594753445
mrs bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger miss lucases 	4.2099613637805815
chapter xvi 	3.5396357525995215
james ' s ? " " never , sir 	4.694335380068905
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough 	3.9889525507766583
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it 	3.7110107217631834
you have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer 	4.059567198824424
in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter 	4.413876588026329
" " you cannot be too much on your guard 	3.33935979674379
" " yes , sir 	2.906991762187295
after a song or two , and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again , she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary , who having , in consequence of being the only plain one in the family , worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments , was always impatient for display 	3.7356266965196525
( by the bye , mrs forster and me are such friends ! ) and so she asked the two harringtons to come , but harriet was ill , and so pen was forced to come by herself 	3.788068761373769
on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer 	3.99278853670214
" if he wants our society , let him seek it 	3.5709103532284256
" yet why did he come ? " she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself 	3.7980182386241528
and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome , discontented or too poor , she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences , silence their complaints , and scold them into harmony and plenty 	4.615631521633821
and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction 	3.5153205478291465
in ran mrs bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " my dear jane , make haste and hurry down 	3.7654573751808527
she related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain 	5.056983793788985
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject 	3.854222142279331
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship ! how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! how much of good or evil must be done by him ! every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before 	3.7292156832224563
if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach 	3.702670940774496
" " it is wonderful , " replied wickham , " for almost all his actions may be traced to pride 	3.8497888191114895
each felt for the other , and of course for themselves 	5.441227427924488
they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve 	4.041572732150229
they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature 	3.190812198258278
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish 	3.7940483109728045
when breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters 	4.331537092112587
" and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out 	4.125003816186371
i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise 	3.458668132041406
she practises very constantly 	4.190729106883143
" " much more rational , my dear caroline , i dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball 	3.93823330008734
" mr darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter 	3.107489839668005
" " not the slightest 	3.909051481522328
she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago 	3.4246080850484533
it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome 	3.3448463712753878
mary and kitty , thank heaven ! are quite well 	3.3076677483386328
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired 	3.7058834446448268
" no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful 	4.331760495236843
if the first , i should be completely in your way 	4.670612056899189
you tear them to pieces 	5.1030902958338595
till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger 	3.2363115248448833
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday , after my father went away 	3.5355822244050663
" " it is more than i engage for , i assure you 	3.4057366839017233
" not yet , " replied jane 	3.928484429608731
and a fortnight only was wanting of it , when a letter arrived from mrs gardiner , which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent 	4.3015255166664845
" and pray what is the result ? " " i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect 	4.083639967393824
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is 	3.5678811553600203
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield 	3.6712160513277112
you are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on 	3.4797815063028916
chapter ix 	3.5396357525995215
re considering events , determining probabilities , and reconciling herself as well as she could , to a change so sudden and so important , fatigue , and a recollection of her long absence , made her at length return home 	3.683298949648937
mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day , and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation , &c 	3.920447053341234
how much you must have gone through ! " her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well 	4.972200279609455
his reception however was of the most flattering kind 	4.457250554837893
but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance 	3.9045933702707116
imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland 	3.2167764004253248
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard , his claims on mr darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed 	4.770103099638845
" while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning 	3.3779542956268513
it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it 	4.218740901596064
chapter ix 	3.5396357525995215
though lydia ' s short letter to mrs f 	4.085679360375011
" i told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy 	4.280956933320548
and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire 	3.8133680740919544
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified 	3.819233770479929
and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark 	3.4328318550121293
but we considered it , we talked of it as impossible 	3.741144437282075
and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome 	3.739472836267373
" elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them 	3.8434751045622804
" " her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town 	3.289315250193826
and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you 	4.257381028074028
and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " he is a man of very large property in derbyshire , i understand 	3.8743313272400983
i am a gentleman ' s daughter 	3.40058389290982
and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey 	3.1990525997902277
but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger 	3.6464227895063432
not lydia only , but all were concerned in it 	3.804088903078589
my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy , to be treating his father ' s favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for 	3.924018381999183
i am afraid you will be angry 	3.6485455050145434
on saturday he came again 	4.03153419577239
his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind 	4.829033796698753
she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them 	3.35996617974397
" " ah ! sir , i do indeed 	3.9601580278659636
miss bingley did the same 	4.370285197490326
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham ! your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions 	3.663945083556089
every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness , such an assurance of the deepest disgrace 	3.7124339525714594
" " to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! what could she mean by it ? it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum 	3.5830429064703293
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected 	3.4573466466091562
" " miss bingley , " said he , " has given me credit for more than can be 	3.2825255451162296
she had been unwilling to mention bingley 	3.627050943136438
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room 	4.068295616685668
but was too angry with lydia , to send any message to her 	3.899360762372692
professor michael s 	4.477593862025218
" " very true , indeed 	3.184559707578964
he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry 	3.785779664797936
at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her 	4.176509539651905
" your great men often are 	3.779286977511909
and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of kitty 	4.167161659583336
" " undoubtedly , " replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation 	4.225004313511729
be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy 	4.937111056266315
the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand 	4.037438678400179
this preservative she had now obtained 	4.869714417014239
one morning , about a week after bingley ' s engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage 	4.043715573580065
let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them 	3.4804556081504696
" " it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire 	3.2266111220805214
" some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from longbourn would come in the evening 	4.107941558805785
i shall now know how to act 	4.206710246105794
" " could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia ' s note to his wife ? " " he brought it with him for us to see 	4.339597934288141
but it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly 	3.914746033226603
to the rest of the family they paid little attention 	3.9022866929174724
far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter 	3.797943598985094
attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham 	5.051315583202242
your ' s , &c 	2.633258899976142
it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return 	3.653350838136282
" " dear lizzy ! " " oh ! you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general 	4.2151344320595125
yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week 	4.4679089370762695
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct 	4.806808194278601
if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham , you must be very happy 	3.942389132736243
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world 	4.639387447171833
chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for my sake 	4.821947469063997
" " i do , i do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " i love him 	3.89946155834394
but , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if i still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion 	3.3618059742530133
on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent 	4.665831874889968
your profusion makes me saving 	3.9300423694798114
chapter vii 	3.8875837814206093
elizabeth could not help saying , " it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so 	4.481908908244679
there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning 	3.9720191443867607
yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over 	3.1641494278645608
with them he is remarkably agreeable 	4.125171189817368
presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on 	3.5583606585312357
mr bennet ' s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation 	4.122232126865905
had elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort 	3.8153816697312317
with no expectation of pleasure , but with the strongest curiosity , elizabeth opened the letter , and to her still increasing wonder , perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper , written quite through , in a very close hand 	3.714484700986508
mrs collins knew not what to make of him 	3.4808167450398484
and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report 	4.306551897585865
" it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment , from which she had been so wholly free at first 	3.469596718926295
and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane 	3.798773362683657
i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood 	4.03974024258378
and neither the carriage , nor the livery of the servant who preceded it , were familiar to them 	4.8292175658055445
and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country 	4.216061506887918
had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best 	3.732301324562141
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind 	3.5275582652069035
that lady i suppose is your mother 	4.532117720688132
there are a lot of things you can do with project gutenberg tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to project gutenberg tm electronic works 	2.855725900929688
in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister 	4.412685457209302
all field sports were over 	4.490988501105387
it pains me to offend you 	5.349622560492655
" their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm 	4.021980256081845
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter 	3.7917786148581185
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good 	3.5260887089401023
for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial 	4.020716103686052
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known 	4.002924675505552
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases , and again during the chief of the day , was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins 	3.3980466459400716
but it will have no effect on me 	4.0268325767601825
he took the hint , and soon began with , " this seems a very comfortable house 	3.4579407692676294
and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections 	3.5145571326124068
she was not rendered formidable by silence 	3.268333181650637
the comfort to her , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression 	4.38097273154644
" " whatever i do is done in a hurry , " replied he 	3.6390657290605666
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london 	3.6609631588710374
and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it 	4.094763663916818
and darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away 	3.9172884552732916
" i do not get on at all 	3.6719203326267866
" mr collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter 	3.229256464619159
she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr darcy 	3.5476979932426276
but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled 	4.3893132865508315
but my dearest love , tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of , that i may have it to morrow 	4.043193670844721
before any answer could arrive from mr collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth , from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge 	4.431429922597844
" " that is not very likely 	3.3939526174741808
" " i do not think we were speaking at all 	2.922617383843368
and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , i felt no doubt of their happiness together 	3.798997496763687
" yours , &c 	2.990907055261009
you refuse , then , to oblige me 	4.192721783194032
miss bennet , i insist on being satisfied 	4.411045515472329
it was not known that wickham had a single relation , with whom he kept up any connection , and it was certain that he had no near one living 	3.6002729391661488
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit 	4.22471298586521
and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of pemberley might be something ! they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door 	3.0358905245127668
" mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner 	3.371626238104129
" i am glad i bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox ! well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home 	3.9463518257622927
but she is very young 	4.20061444732472
they shook hands with great cordiality 	4.519633637721069
and not a note , not a line , did i receive in the mean time 	3.4356293197856846
people do not die of little trifling colds 	3.43945672609236
for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love 	3.8393292515975537
" occupied in observing mr bingley ' s attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend 	4.137353603774844
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not 	4.149179807914005
