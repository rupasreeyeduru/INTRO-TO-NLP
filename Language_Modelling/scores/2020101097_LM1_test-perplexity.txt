k it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment 	443.2922783208373
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening 	924.1829964759462
this was one point , with regard to lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and mr bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him 	214.8777234421122
" " my fingers , " said elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women ' s do 	183.79214223661182
and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her 	1071.26382389398
but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain 	510.8564065591036
" " it will be her turn soon to be teazed , " said miss lucas 	32.85345750042633
he is gone to my father already 	61.29305939509203
and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn 	228.06064654605626
his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! oh ! it must be my uncle ' s doings ! generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself 	392.07042310357895
and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love 	138.6328322293419
after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses 	1090.6163231032237
and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful 	67.29484182960917
i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when mr denny comes back from town 	683.7908348081247
" for we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness 	450.03563202132773
" " i know them a little 	26.90881188029428
had it been your uncle ' s doing , i must and would have paid him 	282.64586797985606
" there is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? " the surprise of such an application was great indeed 	848.8982442283918
every body says that he is ate up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise 	379.7201382539028
" " you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful 	1497.0038432710965
your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget : 'had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner 	232.20012744438077
in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves 	55.96709244330434
i rather wonder now at your knowing any 	447.0664507213426
" whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment 	490.1873409833054
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind ! no , no i feel he may defy us there 	2433.5905097739355
they were all of them warm in their admiration 	189.03051536379868
chapter xii 	2.9674598914339794
and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not decidedly better 	362.8977404201379
" " that is all settled 	3.451560829136489
their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy ' s 	208.00869515307429
and with no one to speak to , of what i felt , no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had ! oh ! how i wanted you ! " " how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved 	1694.579382719727
if you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up 	67.22197308381307
you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner 	949.6285831369155
he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room 	149.9859452829281
it is mr wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars 	31.51323249541286
" " miss eliza bennet , " said miss bingley , " despises cards 	27.55345146602013
and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune 	167.09403245122942
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly 	1475.5102252285167
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive 	377.88319619041255
your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together 	203.26464197985058
she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her 	501.68390815628953
" well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ? is not he a charming man ? i am sure my sisters must all envy me 	172.45804625152695
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed 	839.8789551800093
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your ' s 	218.94557350053307
i must find mr gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed 	575.0491966677642
to jane , he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused , and whose merit she had undervalued 	641.2661567100299
mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding 	34.038312118235446
mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper 	1755.2105512224198
but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks 	1180.1412461814282
the feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten 	1006.8114776594828
and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing , that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood , before she was banished to the north 	176.99788276234614
and there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart 	221.2427978557158
it must be an amusing study 	190.79345872380588
" he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word 	134.77154201394816
nobody wants him to come 	293.9567019027986

she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings , and had sent for him only the saturday before , to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening 	inf
" when i consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that i might have prevented it ! i who knew what he was 	347.7466877576294
and the hursts have no horses to theirs 	185.45388897718584
mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party 	367.07192368316316
but in vain 	3.7909941054483722
if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough 	100.66275650163305
i am sick of them all 	11.27580421584039
you do not look well 	49.65171670893587
i dare say i shall soon see them here 	90.99928490939214
and , consequently , that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning 	115.62453594145767
oh ! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged , every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him 	844.8305960360489
but now we may be silent 	90.86610553819357
" i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude 	344.3588109907301
but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " oh ! mamma , do the people here abouts know i am married to day ? i was afraid they might not 	1167.3895885598802
i am not equal to it 	17.360482503779505
they are in the same profession , you know 	69.75972818990272
mrs gardiner ' s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone 	185.87350293210332
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared 	69.20315254213351
but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour 	48.47438332203038
for else they will be destitute enough 	348.11713227018686
" i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness 	346.8140127675538
they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself 	369.6102331144847
when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " by the bye , charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield ? i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party 	844.2327925991387
" at that moment they were met from another walk , by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself 	543.7453860865593
" it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man 	349.866297327647
what a delightful library you have at pemberley , mr darcy ! " " it ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many generations 	73.22744616762365
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way 	468.2711360478687
" " you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate 	96.42880089921348
an hour , however , saw the whole completed 	95.29538592532147
i hate such false friends 	544.8289102979114
under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief 	1788.9951980785127
" she found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , " i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ? " " i have never heard him say so 	258.5959044847837
and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair 	258.20848532020784
jane certainly could not come back 	243.98875307560186
" her aunt assured her that she was 	40.22369044023665
" my dearest child , " she cried , " i can think of nothing else ! ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! 'tis as good as a lord ! and a special licence 	102.28722818878398
and poor mr darcy ! dear lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered 	825.738095041203
" don't keep coughing so , kitty , for heaven ' s sake ! have a little compassion on my nerves 	969.8051325909083
i came to try you 	66.65245713010742
the note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with 	inf
but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman 	938.4399625303703
colonel forster will , i dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head 	229.37042338365765
and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about 	1844.9807425987271
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case 	30.914723921325475
it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world 	380.23214432650025
a younger son , you know , must be inured to self denial and dependence 	134.45919467067773
" mr wickham ' s attention was caught 	14.515043994770824
" " i do not mind his not talking to mrs long , " said miss lucas , " but i wish he had danced with eliza 	225.89339562595262
" oh ! she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld ! but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and i dare say , very agreeable 	316.69422628276965
" " no more have i , " said mr bennet 	44.569198345542695
and then when we came away it was such fun ! i thought we never should have got into the coach 	1440.4496214734997
and one of my own daughters 	38.81834228199726
and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably 	522.0840968836818
after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight 	1875.8229285489756
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn 	717.7932248024478
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane ' s happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring 	441.71890829362684
" how strange this is ! and for this we are to be thankful 	329.05564428006056
and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister 	129.52633835563122
" without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first 	1175.8971547857345
" " and your defect is a propensity to hate every body 	200.25518555598197
you are lucky in having such a master 	428.85181340875283
" vol 	4.035453243491721
for your sake , " turning to charlotte , " i am glad of it 	126.6520908417066
" " you make me laugh , charlotte 	181.48234606086694
and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ' s affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question 	457.62046197539956
once or twice she could discern a faint blush 	591.5181334449911
a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade 	639.0278797077434
" " and of your infliction , " cried elizabeth with energy 	18.592126246494452
" " not at all , " he replied 	5.673479970986142
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct 	419.25892526130104
but i know the foundation is unjust 	123.20765703263051
and very unwillingly said so 	350.65531073570787
i will take care of myself , and of mr wickham too 	37.504159776060334
as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last 	221.69572923680573
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours 	1500.2152950098048
the more i see of the world , the more am i dissatisfied with it 	315.80080717859965
" " mr darcy is all politeness , " said elizabeth , smiling 	46.962791099912856
yet , indeed , i am in earnest 	51.668192572715505
my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart 	1280.7038393468247
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more 	240.39558623760422
and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed 	547.8308993254997
and , above all things , keep mr bennet from fighting 	734.1924799502153
darcy said nothing at all 	52.08115319231132
i am glad he dines here on tuesday 	57.56842894513049
on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate 	14.198574805680833
and whatever he did , done gracefully 	220.7909704909059
" " your picture may be very exact , louisa , " said bingley 	112.52227752607757
i mend pens remarkably well 	779.4450793258336
" " and you saw him frequently ? " " yes , almost every day 	69.00386635918304
with a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee 	516.5045473926685
her astonishment , however , was extreme 	20.625304412247836
if i can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too 	646.4920860026388
and now we are better 	50.21311191092404
elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion 	660.9111403833083
a respectable looking , elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her 	1088.9974479700538
" indeed i have , sir , " was her answer 	10.400150790047075
but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour 	1169.4731885483825
those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable 	2644.0853753543374
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education 	201.5996225682818
her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object 	187.4761871281077
for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms 	128.4561448555905
and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it 	71.83837854212156
and after observing mr collins for a few moments , he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh 	128.72315251570987
it is impossible for me to be impartial 	4.05485805216143
and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth ! what do i not owe you ! you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous 	5168.832980040583
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good natured , gossiping lucases 	1645.5505388689025
colonel fitzwilliam ' s occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her 	1073.0029824971282
and i am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune 	177.15962916570024
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when mr collins joining in , observed , " yes , miss elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church , and i need not say you will be delighted with her 	457.24864366928125
mr wickham ' s chief object was unquestionably my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds 	196.2356286050298
and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement 	98.01283213136804
after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations 	557.607654712488
" " i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind 	359.33097865189274
but sir william ' s good breeding carried him through it all 	284.078855620816
on his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , " let me call your maid 	143.43506762619182
" it was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on 	135.25839779428136
she will follow wherever lydia leads 	744.9167146621775
on this point she was soon satisfied 	84.82914750597719
we must not make him desperate 	20.506386138219856
their table was superlatively stupid 	250.7098463876023
but really , and upon my honour , i will try to do what i think to be wisest 	199.54622760486112
" he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away 	4218.694512505082
here was knowledge in which no one could partake 	549.6772663971827
advice , which there was every reason to believe would be attended to 	628.4615267866009
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it 	129.7027714141346
and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane , with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy 	588.4980916377003
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other 	838.8723211795749
lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention 	628.7677690297347
there he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself 	172.09415592320508
will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? " and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight 	298.7232695804037
but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ' s countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched 	295.29779486737567
mr wickham ' s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and mr collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could 	203.3424498455052
mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill 	1357.987414194923
having never even fancied herself in love before , her regard had all the warmth of first attachment , and from her age and disposition , greater steadiness than first attachments often boast 	9047.071035237765
" as soon as ever mr bingley comes , my dear , " said mrs bennet , " you will wait on him of course 	63.368360116136365
she followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee 	993.8327078188175
mr collins was eloquent in her praise 	8.26268296790679
" " and my mother how is she ? how are you all ? " " my mother is tolerably well , i trust 	383.76400196830025
but the ladies were ready enough to talk , and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement , nor inclined to be silent himself 	671.894837100317
she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park 	104.48058635867835
" " i am talking of possibilities , charles 	114.75401080432167
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned 	887.3789945783543
has thrown herself into the power of of mr wickham 	538.5717209680156
" i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter ! " " la ! my dear , " said maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not lady catherine 	485.76114911950253
the country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , mr bingley ? " " when i am in the country , " he replied , " i never wish to leave it 	137.39048507086142
" " yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight 	108.81777362455061
" lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer 	1424.0378401902547
" " i shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you 	82.20393880780041
and all for the sake of mr collins too ! why should he have it more than anybody else ? " " i leave it to yourself to determine , " said mr bennet 	317.5499146534552
and what sort of young lady is she ? is she handsome ? " " she is a most charming young lady indeed 	944.0914262907004
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement 	700.2538788135847
" mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies 	189.78253343370787
and from such as had been already visible below , she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy ' s , in crayons , whose subjects were usually more interesting , and also more intelligible 	487.98630939925107
" " pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? where does discretion end , and avarice begin ? last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent 	1619.1770645253332
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over 	1443.7470898886165
" but perhaps you would like to read it 	53.37358979658192
but , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt 	136.5016969053348
i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , i have seen nothing of it 	644.9781429123178
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd 	1703.9157193409142
the tête à tête surprised them 	125.3680301669366
we are all in an uproar 	22.372703868588705
" you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire , my dear cousin 	298.20298879897103
and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield 	647.0043978580616
mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family 	132.08505547022295
when she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner ' s in town , so much in love with her , that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away 	167.86428990471668
every park has its beauty and its prospects 	2048.9616131540033
her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous 	inf
" there is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said kitty 	60.842050566850624
i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements 	1680.0599834366528
if i have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was unknowingly done 	24.862540212828797
sir william staid only a week at hunsford 	168.49222794594067
" this was invitation enough 	84.9995319344845
among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous 	452.10865421117364
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all 	1147.2731979758419
as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr darcy , and mr darcy only , entered the room 	1609.0907121116545
" " well , my dear , " said mr bennet , when elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley , and under your orders 	212.56092502065638
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money 	435.28253408293585
he repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence 	665.7378727167902
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley 	253.55121312092712
" elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had 	170.0466420780651
she could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress 	825.8127073476144
but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister ' s absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized 	1342.8389801984977
" " depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , i will visit them all 	85.2221740748245
" to complete the favourable impression , she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia 	1206.9213692752132
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented 	152.11150840438333
his countenance rather gained in austerity 	443.4400483475479
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley , " i can guess the subject of your reverie 	182.1956526210073
" " at four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace making gentleman , " said mr bennet , as he folded up the letter 	372.2618681984212
a clear ten thousand per annum 	607.7467922007307
but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection 	1153.232668235832
" " but you forget , mama , " said elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that mrs long has promised to introduce him 	92.346770736103
her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her 	2583.8230977052017
and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it 	224.04042710159027
" " what , none of you ? " " not one 	55.12467503275793
and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected 	1411.4838516216716
" i must ask whether you were surprised ? " said elizabeth 	222.95733020617325
" darcy smiled and said , " you are perfectly right 	134.46231500835455
it was at sir william lucas ' s , where a large party were assembled 	62.90915076038974
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection 	503.59411980691834
and in her air altogether , there is a self sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable 	468.6184939313237
their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge 	1927.1278642078569
but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine 	670.0741599219627
" " oh ! certainly , " cried his faithful assistant , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with 	323.6841742416227
she was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged 	1307.4772627648342
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present 	173.63982554068
at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book ! when i have a house of my own , i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library 	1060.9261737981963
but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected 	1997.418929950148
i must confess myself surprised by your application 	296.20045666062515
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham , and rejoiced in it 	64.6844582586894
they are my old friends 	380.96451325190986
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night 	1840.7760907428726
you are charmingly group'd , and appear to uncommon advantage 	130.37356104905027
though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak 	1235.998376391782
could there be finer symptoms ? is not general incivility the very essence of love ? " " oh , yes ! of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt 	408.2256066867354
but with such a father and mother , and such low connections , i am afraid there is no chance of it 	123.43106262667717
" " no " said darcy , " i have made no such pretension 	26.45446464753941
and if they are not married already , make them marry 	310.72760758348915
and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them 	1332.2491946483908
my child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life 	747.9277123458112
the discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome 	870.345005032575
" " the present always occupies you in such scenes does it ? " said he , with a look of doubt 	108.866831815665
the least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person 	1998.5391496347643
would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress 	8006.369298518823
and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia 	871.1983439731883
nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard 	386.5458889327003
but mr collins , much offended , laid aside his book , and said , " i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit 	2489.97874969677
" they will join me early to morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , mr bingley and his sisters 	746.7182511858026
" " i suspected as much , " replied elizabeth 	63.8920640461479
and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at longbourn 	718.8292077116532
and without any intention of coming back again 	93.3301842962755
at length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready 	736.8797960620205
first , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion 	565.0279280775552
" " your first position is false 	102.68857063924737
" and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ! oh , that i knew how it was ! " but wishes were vain 	1047.2508046456787
as a child i was taught what was right , but i was not taught to correct my temper 	540.1401378982417
after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt 	854.6125319117765
" this information made elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor miss bingley 	505.0055881383676
towards him i have been kinder than towards myself 	1020.9094449417062
it makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else 	747.58974348733
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable 	750.7228128254299
i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent 	268.00487374133377
these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce 	420.27656334009237
" i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia , " said she , " though i am not her particular friend 	302.3322276472492
having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business 	1358.6794046494597
and of late it has been shifting about pretty much 	668.5302705584801
tell him what a dreadful state i am in , that i am frightened out of my wits 	672.2913556488774
but he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not 	1094.9019320014247
i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier 	100.49745448136082
her reflections were in general satisfactory 	449.96453568213883
she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances : and to have mr collins instead ! her liveliness had been never worse timed 	16181.960056381275
it was an evening of no common delight to them all 	204.66546109242518
if , indeed , such a report is in existence 	21.220570314817888
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her 	484.87668580696936
but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road 	886.9638407194493
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference 	556.9104956486028
" but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation 	1347.5651103852604
" " my dear , you flatter me 	40.854778506735784
his disposition must be dreadful 	96.17988363895996
" " it is no such thing 	9.3104765434416
" " this account then is what he has received from mr darcy 	260.86876635990865
we were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary 	81.90455888442197
" about a month , " said elizabeth 	15.608504219107314
" your ' s sincerely , &c 	57.54477721166331
the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice 	1862.9286526720355
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule 	2195.4260977437884
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede 	542.6092518127906
" " i have no right to give my opinion , " said wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise 	82.45598350317682
i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it 	257.73037095346325
" " well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right 	10.301600690062415
" in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it 	228.62757149566752
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these 	35.037144434336845
many smiled 	71.85634019600515
what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received ! he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex 	2029.191391300625
kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia ' s last letter , she had prepared her for such a step 	396.59968507345735
" my dear , dear lizzy , i would i do congratulate you but are you certain ? forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? " " there can be no doubt of that 	369.3525758921943
compliments always take you by surprise , and me never 	2120.7032623754844
" i have not seen her for many years , but i very well remember that i never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent 	180.35266384252913
donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks , online payments and credit card donations 	17602.29338600115
because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth 	1034.4431364029451
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected " for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow 	679.0581267632008
" then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself 	210.0238361217834
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching 	2880.4816468312647
shall i get you one ? you are very ill 	2810.4509991897326
they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them 	120.55196976211556
it seems but a fortnight i declare 	145.6679651294961
the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor 	1032.580294185317
royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation at the address specified in section <num>, " information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation 	580.5969860346597
other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose fordyce ' s sermons 	1207.0749657097301
but if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away 	576.62729256832
she had no conversation , no style , no taste , no beauty 	903.1191332412482
they had frequently been staying with her in town 	448.24694006734654
and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone 	972.2800536106233
he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party 	299.8727054025117
the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity 	3967.9728606736085
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions 	194.7832332905832
one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions 	829.9404994973247
" " you must not blame my aunt 	39.46613503938523
" " certainly , sir 	8.73382700929031
the next was in these words 	47.27461733911323
" elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend 	129.16815388066348
" elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word 	73.9907270318853
it was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject 	254.69894563204264
" jane and elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay 	88.53867431250882
she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest , but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering 	1383.5621165221814
" " she is a great fool for going away , if she liked him 	48.267288499963904
mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received 	855.2467984218164
she was met in the vestibule by lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , " i am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! what do you think has happened this morning ? mr collins has made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have him 	212.86810334662718
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , i dare say 	19.461502923317042
and the girls smiled on each other 	58.222789302223866
" indeed , jane , you ought to believe me 	30.950497152408932
miss bingley saw all this likewise 	80.7297856538468
lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball 	76.42996182824577
" i dare say you will find him very agreeable 	44.67765130004902
i am the happiest creature in the world 	10.835134471533143
" she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley 	inf
mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley ' s visit in gracechurch street , and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself , which proved that the former had , from her heart , given up the acquaintance 	644.280485821616
james ' s , with very decent composure 	83.15973728590059
the possibility of mr collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two 	167.07849430335665
when mrs bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before 	1068.6059189203654
and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted 	328.065018815725
" i am astonished , my dear , " said mrs bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly 	36.1575409080105
" if he does not come to me , then , " said she , " i shall give him up for ever 	17.11170492564886
as that was the case , neither jane , to whom i related the whole , nor i , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public 	483.0194225005234
but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years 	1205.823816254561
" " the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so 	340.4124733015669
i want to talk very seriously 	117.57584678380711
that is the place to get husbands 	54.589015004048804
for though i am the youngest , i'm the tallest 	75.33259060793971
girls , can i do any thing for you in meryton ? oh ! here comes hill 	2082.602532156994
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again 	1197.593285586454
a carat character is used to denote superscription 	81.05352573717235
at that instant she felt , that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends , for moments of such painful confusion 	3859.9881499758467
i have done with you from this very day 	158.46009111828116
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements 	3760.168108903508
we will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen 	472.6032452745201
" " you are quite right 	7.81761835258263
elizabeth felt jane ' s pleasure 	82.09217695819817
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her 	148.5325993935883
he had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go 	631.9655501769482
in three volumes 	3.389985165385635
but , however , i hope it is not true 	27.9577005529099
when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room 	181.98829020927005
she saw all the glories of the camp 	8.614396543070225
" and is this all ? " cried elizabeth 	38.983035678242395
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude 	2742.268415248025
but their astonishment was beyond their expectation 	172.82225396733858
we acted with the best intentions 	1072.243657714734
and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , " my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing ? mr darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner 	561.8741937573852
" " a great deal of good management , depend upon it 	inf
gregory b 	4.11657523575709
when she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it 	65.64801886247737
and in spite of his being a lover , elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity , to be rationally founded , because they had for basis the excellent understanding , and super excellent disposition of jane , and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself 	1396.453933112458
" what an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut 	190.31208145487844
" elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment ' s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion 	1436.4378471589919
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far 	909.6675993278238
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia 	140.08157597459754
but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent 	251.27584367938772
" mr bingley followed his advice 	186.85040125290826
elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia 	517.5434578849984
the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you 	333.03974210535614
but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane 	63.66399230023809
" " and do you impute it to either of those ? " " yes 	61.93599186767736
they were of course all intending to be surprised 	139.23153076994427
as the day of his arrival drew near , " i begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said jane to her sister 	91.86668443806244
" miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister ' s warm affection 	2019.5127947785927
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement 	130.77226246797173
w 	5.398697534743407
and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp 	1480.4104801228355
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcy ' s farther notice 	250.2793399298655
she must own that she was tired of great houses 	inf
if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen 	112.36598978405671
it should not be said , that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers 	133.7645261312873
kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters 	423.07921509155165
james ' s had made him courteous 	53.90960482638216
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was 	297.43839684446147
" " lizzy , " said her father , " i have given him my consent 	22.81978376358383
" i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family 	88.7122868214794
" " you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters 	347.5509457348195
" thursday was to be the wedding day , and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit 	1445.8615854119514
" but how could that be ? how could his will be disregarded ? why did not you seek legal redress ? " " there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law 	723.0210923020235
yes , yes 	8.018715591896267
therefore , stay quietly at longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care 	209.25301213288034
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes 	455.19027601095297
but are you pleased , jane ? shall you like to have such a brother ? " " very , very much 	573.1621354381161
but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful 	298.6830299798431
for as to mr darcy ' s using him ill , it is perfectly false 	539.5929704833508
though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice 	210.7454941723593
i know not what to think 	3.5469829491365195
and mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings 	3724.833081264719
for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men 	666.6197226157437
that he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating 	50.24670045148852
" in darcy ' s presence she dared not mention wickham ' s name 	190.73756353181284
she wanted to hear of him , when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence 	127.6295652363286
such a change in a man of so much pride , excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love , ardent love , it must be attributed 	1410.2854065581096
but would my giving you the wished for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ? supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged 	3564.231859926736
at first 	7.453992024560722
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas 	66.64522252652527
the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy 	461.94558095335805
and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant 	2027.7256030905799
and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came 	399.79637878960375
and he scarcely opened his lips 	112.20629531877898
but if we do not venture , somebody else will 	613.5643317867299
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare 	850.4405563568209
" " obstinate , headstrong girl ! i am ashamed of you ! is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? is nothing due to me on that score ? " let us sit down 	3295.7665816350577
the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham ' s worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him 	530.7845247288003
chapter x 	2.9674598914339794
for forty years , he produced and distributed project gutenberg tm ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support 	1227.3487835462784
" " such as vanity and pride 	74.36002411807138
but consider how much it must increase his disappointment 	2030.4267471042667
bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied 	320.612380844597
" " and can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? " " i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship 	649.2986061634595
and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter 	9996.821424608215
they could talk of nothing but officers 	234.34247487609014
the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions 	481.6342925972071
chapter xviii 	2.9674598914339794
he certainly looked at her friend a great deal , but the expression of that look was disputable 	339.11399364313036
all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation 	559.3648918099507
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable 	935.299842240374
i must speak to hill , this moment 	139.01142193731138
" what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment 	82.1670303917544
" " her daughter , miss de bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates 	139.9885767225964
though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill 	2275.978309015376
" " nor i , i am sure , " said miss bingley 	34.62617940350666
but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield 	306.4581203854705
mr what ' s his name 	951.3481131471076
their father was in neither 	141.20970215089818
" " of whom does jane ever think ill ? and who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is 	3128.24179520746
lydia does not leave me because she is married 	635.7710057576268
and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear 	1094.0567934626847
it originated in mrs gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth ' s arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s 	303.6880316304819
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her 	568.2961472006727
poor dear child ! and now here ' s mr bennet gone away , and i know he will fight wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? the collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave 	1715.23275280725
the sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her 	137.3281514223606
but here he was set right by mrs bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen 	298.4892461325468
lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " do you know , mama , that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard , and if he does , colonel forster will hire him 	913.9772709959198
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry miss darcy 	244.7836663327003
she was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place 	774.0965091100553
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece 	816.0889460160824
the other is charlotte ' s marriage 	19.28980292644834
mr darcy is engaged to my _ 	92.36826090613256
i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well informed woman for the rest of her life 	300.34210827858294
thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business 	235.743239886211
" she times them ill 	481.41895780268976
and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself 	620.5016975975615
" do you prefer reading to cards ? " said he 	403.16038635062887
but pride where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation 	1067.5971609119852
" while i can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough 	59.25251046026649
too good for the waiter , is not it ? there is no danger of wickham ' s marrying mary king 	375.9089307222609
till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance 	53.81574330570598
" " i see no occasion for that 	8.389639352073385
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory 	28.110997501285865
miss darcy , on her brother ' s entrance , exerted herself much more to talk 	72.43653409718894
" elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit 	237.470173420157
you see on what a footing we are 	129.68474986259514
but i must write no more 	53.42345719294988
oh ! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! " wickham , lydia , were all forgotten 	280.50479282959475
" but so we all do 	43.3654289964582
this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled 	649.3483636906975
yes , miss bennet , interest 	40.216523789111356
give me farther particulars 	121.92911900239729
" " i did not know before , " continued bingley immediately , " that you were a studier of character 	41.55642137993194
when they repaired to the dining room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister 	390.0826877109073
and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation 	375.79168166132524
pemberley was now georgiana ' s home 	1301.802511498993
with many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous 	749.2870651142989
if an individual project gutenberg tm electronic work is derived from the public domain ( does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder ), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the united states without paying any fees or charges 	645.7557341382363
but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising 	360.4641161809933
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned 	606.8804648748986
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined 	206.17180689173466
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? " elizabeth excused herself as well as she could 	150.76647215853575
wont it , kitty ? " kitty owned that she had rather stay at home 	421.8675356065198
and when she rose to take leave , elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room 	290.84465162458
and i understand from mrs gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the south 	102.02490010106874
but she was flattered and pleased 	249.86307117986962
the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise 	918.2101515639926
" but it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded 	186.10041284320394
" " oh ! your uncle ! he keeps a man servant , does he ? i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things 	553.9754862451026
" tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley ' s 	722.7520032840126
" elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to colonel fitzwilliam , " your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word i say 	705.4976667094218
they were ignorant , idle , and vain 	68.01667079583093
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion 	200.73333533688336
for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as i could 	496.2612794105762
" " upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except netherfield 	303.89829565080174
unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg : <num>	393.77811609584506
and she spoke very little , except in a low voice , to mrs jenkinson , in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable , and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said , and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes 	331.4928136040103
and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it 	299.98968270722
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street 	524.3849666135909
i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage 	53.609667286356725
mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend 	290.0556078670407
for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom 	3457.827026806916
" oh , yes ! he was to come there with wickham , you know 	29.95576692952559
that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly 	2429.0908040871896
but i do not think there would have been any fun in it 	141.1510819581659
about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion 	1414.7977691869687
that speech savours strongly of disappointment 	3750.7632607743867
whatever he said , was said well 	121.97843316330655
i am always glad to get a young person well placed out 	956.6131460417978
and so , my dear sister , i find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen pemberley 	143.48592808935186
kitty was the only one who shed tears 	123.53881911351385
conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain 	430.2232151313106
long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided 	434.37707068797187
not , however , from any fear of disadvantage from it , individually to herself 	294.81408386056904
that he has neither integrity nor honour 	44.77901424303398
it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her 	506.18445228116457
she told the story however with great spirit among her friends 	2016.2518442607957
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible 	359.7381315173644
" elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce 	146.27578065032347
and the kindness of the late mr darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words 	847.7760498271707
" and pray may i ask ? " but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , " is it in address that he improves ? has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? for i dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials 	631.7501882375064
" " are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? " " i never saw such a woman 	85.66830101899151
we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode 	1595.5943419469138
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do 	526.7461731449256
elizabeth was pleased to find , that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend , for , though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world , she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him 	482.92435365770547
bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them 	222.6478180606394
" it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single 	1346.3701109200363
each of them deep in thought 	94.20857068389313
" " and so ended his affection , " said elizabeth impatiently 	51.7427097244324
and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own 	729.654191775351
" miss bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere 	76.94961453862355
and so accomplished ! she plays and sings all day long 	539.7669700289279
not all that mrs bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley 	586.9704564085945
" as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood 	603.7692151459013
with the mention of derbyshire , there were many ideas connected 	238.43952016618536
by you , i was properly humbled 	326.47235840163506
but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation 	197.1962384665669
she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations 	464.86999894336674
" grieved shocked 	374.45159936469963
her ladyship was highly incensed 	23.62122586781681
london : printed for t 	2.8218322634246795
and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do 	2388.9598218432848
you will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him 	9.06046413864198
our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered 	884.6834952733591
brother in law of wickham ! every kind of pride must revolt from the connection 	1429.7214364461238
that the young man ' s marrying her , was a patched up business , at the expence of your father and uncles 	102.74315010522632
" " i do not at all know 	8.265968781108597
there was good humour and kindness 	53.2455506174886
but on perceiving mr darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner 	1972.1022747725028
and yet there have been things enough happened in the time 	1026.953089581452
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal 	1237.5101086274503
remember that she is one of a large family 	498.056946803837
" when my eyes were opened to his real character 	106.53063219939162
inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care 	213.22451896712386
i will read it to you " when my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to london , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it cannot be so , and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel 	1736.7845372329607
you could not make me happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so 	120.98320469564158
" she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment 	1444.416687410114
but is it certain , absolutely certain ? " " oh yes ! they left brighton together on sunday night , and were traced almost to london , but not beyond 	2756.7382957821346
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous 	121.72785683913843
this was very amiable , but charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of 	568.8430648168816
and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest 	1039.2580979252316
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise 	1608.9803815622467
he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise 	1188.2566430075353
but i will not repine 	23.49541889973641
" " can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? " " this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage 	4375.159058413393
this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving 	507.13054090385623
she dreaded seeing wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible 	428.88556434925215
charlotte the wife of mr collins , was a most humiliating picture ! and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen 	847.0540213302777
at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do 	429.5452073940279
" " and if i had not a letter to write myself , i might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did 	337.4928305066503
i wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent 	790.2347673932703
but mrs bennet , was not so well pleased with it 	33.23664842438032
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy 	1507.891217627058
" but surely , " said she , " i may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me 	405.33384721150577
her answer was warmly in his favour 	297.42612594259253
in a short time , i shall have a daughter married 	30.041937005254248
at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas ' s accidental information , that bingley ' s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage 	509.3888314242744
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming 	913.2734683561781
mr bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy 	557.0548880264721
" do you certainly leave kent on saturday ? " said she 	250.1589357964453
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes 	115.98069254725156
" " our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money 	3596.550667653805
give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err 	5147.691747567019
nothing could console and nothing appease her 	588.4324280578794
" chapter xiii 	2.7454326203140167
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long 	291.41963695656614
she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit 	346.71256359801873
" it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened 	379.72186410925826
but don't imagine it was from any silly cause 	4922.1633355245895
there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! such an openness and gentleness in his manner 	231.58420492644535
" " is my father in town ? " " yes , he went on tuesday as i wrote you word 	367.06645569668416
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return 	1805.1297154440542
" " this is quite shocking ! he deserves to be publicly disgraced 	89.501800575449
" " you know nothing of the matter 	11.834272847532326
and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite 	453.3023391498599
" but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it 	117.75577093831781
but at last on mrs bennet ' s leaving them together , after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master , she could not help saying , " oh ! that my dear mother had more command over herself 	517.991911529846
" in meryton they parted 	93.02569576989046
" and will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? " " i will make no promise of the kind 	602.3236536697544
if any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement , the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law 	333.334413594043
lady catherine ' s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts 	243.63167850876215
when first mr bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless 	1903.5242497747267
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children 	205.53996701593906
" he is certainly a good brother , " said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows 	77.40300693937107
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts 	1433.9822124110763
and secondly , of my room 	19.316972336116883
you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people 	79.10605121717185
to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery 	908.5514410113855
i am impatient to see him 	32.955979135075296
but these things happen so often ! a young man , such as you describe mr bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent 	644.5239447361796
she is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all 	286.0645453552201
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man 	188.05564702879107
but , had she still felt any , it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself , on seeing her again 	2198.8309243396675
" " it is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill 	422.07402095488305
but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent 	1306.777852799456
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it 	84.30821965827582

i have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle 	645.4535033924496
mr denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , mr wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps 	1951.8949229670418
society , i own , is necessary to me 	218.14941082329082
and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband 	371.8885373831489
in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret 	283.96329448176937
they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , i do not know how long 	207.78571058422233
" how abominable ! i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you ! if from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest , for dishonesty i must call it 	1213.2714416449712
our situation with regard to lady catherine ' s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast 	inf
" mr bennet made no answer 	3.2174200003860762
he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it 	240.5688344588954
but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere 	480.592813249052
i told him , moreover , that i believed myself mistaken in supposing , as i had done , that your sister was indifferent to him 	381.74081777833544
clement ' s , because wickham ' s lodgings were in that parish 	620.7141675283455
but of course she did not mention my name to you 	83.56984851550833
many stared 	133.287472231918
family pride , and filial pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this 	863.035592557435
said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning 	565.7543221270276
besides , there was truth in his looks 	419.5308432589554
at length there was nothing more to be said 	60.37831477763145
he called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself 	416.5896592708715
seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence 	365.05994673839297
" i will go to meryton , " said she , " as soon as i am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister philips 	140.67804232689954
what shall we do with him ? lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley ' s way 	364.95581144363206
chapter xii 	2.9674598914339794
but i always speak what i think 	39.52499960269622
" " in marrying your nephew , i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere 	110.17522187783557
and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town 	146.7109059317293
there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be 	819.9435944145466
" what do you think ? it is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like 	1152.4519832167696
he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear 	94.98786416529494
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention 	2219.9743245822283
mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me 	360.48278777650205
and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball 	264.0685864602961
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together 	697.4122875469212
but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr and mrs collins ' s happiness 	inf
" i have found out , " said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness 	255.45837606769106
" mrs bennet and her daughters then departed , and elizabeth returned instantly to jane , leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy 	317.10614026617714
it was really attentive 	43.280651577138094
" " write to me very often , my dear 	102.87607762123253
" " i admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason 	73.9747305753911

but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received 	414.89541845531
the housekeeper came forward , and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman , the son of her late master ' s steward , who had been brought up by him at his own expence 	414.51792489230894

but it had not been so in derbyshire 	56.96550990985224
who could about such a nasty little freckled thing ? " elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal ! as soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered 	2862.6287255296374
and when mr bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was 	2753.074651613749
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " " if we are ever able to learn what wickham ' s debts have been , " said elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own 	1297.7676495040334

and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects 	279.5898082164406
" " your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said darcy , " has too much truth 	149.5540482328409
at length the parsonage was discernible 	183.15616045965547
lady catherine observed , after dinner , that miss bennet seemed out of spirits , and immediately accounting for it herself , by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon , she added , " but if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer 	294.50248257312745
" elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend 	136.0199767987759
" " oh ! then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you 	142.03984276999321
how grievous then was the thought that , of a situation so desirable in every respect , so replete with advantage , so promising for happiness , jane had been deprived , by the folly and indecorum of her own family ! when to these recollections was added the developement of wickham ' s character , it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before , were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful 	2024.2873329138745
you need not 	7.885371199325598
" mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while mrs bennet was stirring the fire 	443.1924625658478
" then addressing her daughter , " oh ! my dear , dear jane , i am so happy ! i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night 	49.683071712575114
it was unpardonable 	40.68129975473421
and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there 	1985.5937060503027
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination 	652.3216285444457
the party did not supply much conversation 	937.8530693917479
it was to this effect : " since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature 	1398.0350063992944
these recollections will not do at all 	174.5216894641924
the pause was to elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful 	352.647880391752
a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing 	227.36262180864387
and mr bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " but is there not danger of lady catherine ' s disapprobation here , my good sir ? you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness 	1391.038579055693
" elizabeth could not oppose such a wish 	21.21527406333964

it is a pity they are not handsome ! not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend 	1463.2701643827568
it was first broken by mrs annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others 	2745.5075470634274
" " then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said mrs bennet 	67.45575673494223
it is a nice long walk , and mr darcy has never seen the view 	311.2515415381821
she is on her road somewhere , i dare say , and so passing through meryton , thought she might as well call on you 	739.5363207873442
if you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment 	67.63316832565644

he heard her with astonishment 	14.578316544736392

my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made 	726.9987118611394
which will not be yours till after your mother ' s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to 	311.3574995115188
and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is 	80.86578154350455
mr darcy was punctual in his return , and as lydia informed you , attended the wedding 	276.8019130170989
" " and so was i 	68.02607607233313
however , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were 	188.8777755624275
" you are joking , lizzy 	17.3974524395056
when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible 	3169.356912453564
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow 	1454.8685418909608
they met again on sunday , and then i saw him too 	148.0122964392569
and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there 	704.2018276685892
and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them 	952.0413561126327
from elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent 	398.1167747631931
your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land 	695.7194573437439
" " care of him ! yes , i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care 	1329.8083627328785
his apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else 	66.48984793340516
" the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner 	100.71664398350622
elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william ' s too long 	260.83369089488474
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening 	358.92487888915184
mr collins then returned to elizabeth 	176.4205376788273
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her 	452.93513655171904
and , turning to elizabeth , said , " miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room 	461.5219980934307
causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me 	1814.4037935086953
and then thought no more of the matter : and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them , restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike 	2747.410557399068
as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits 	54.5533988638688
you dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind 	714.2448438214032
you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention 	2261.3423196950234
" " my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents 	2299.552117821815
and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn 	120.09761140025287
but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr darcy walk into the room 	259.79890071008174
but his anger , i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ' s sentiments 	527.2847635249108
" " and what am i to do on the occasion ? it seems an hopeless business 	290.5939545983513
though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage 	189.42969879974302
good bye 	5.645326903105012
wickham passed all his youth there , you know 	1131.0868529729066
i dare say the lace upon mrs hurst ' s gown " here she was interrupted again 	2658.613141707473
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe 	954.8205654720252
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece 	624.5829457426358
her complexion has no brilliancy 	124.59482427486365
you both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage 	332.928673928478
anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil 	2456.062400696163
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " i have never had a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years old 	371.5369800859674
after tea , mr bennet retired to the library , as was his custom , and mary went up stairs to her instrument 	255.60697475455694
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking 	271.78936939908544
but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane ' s sake , you know 	36.72780143562629
" " believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention 	695.4198570514354
but there are two things that i want very much to know : one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about 	3215.918797533878
but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin 	2307.980786439773
what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy ? you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing 	706.1810949474293
the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual 	746.9430571078498
had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite 	512.2478068969281
the world has been deceived in that respect 	150.21641602196223
and they parted at last with mutual civility , and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again 	954.527656284269
" mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand 	622.6068025343938
and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it 	517.6367700938325
could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected 	74.19846343968369
she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther 	1932.8803171103482
" i am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she 	26.119199431238922
after sitting a little while with jane , on miss bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour 	666.3778444482153
or me either , for that matter 	636.9923860548764
" " how should you have liked making sermons ? " " exceedingly well 	419.207411692669
" " that will not do for a compliment to darcy , caroline , " cried her brother " because he does not write with ease 	188.28397517469327
and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings 	547.7315375108875
but since he had been in the militia , it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them 	201.47763653350341
but lydia , with perfect indifference , continued to express her admiration of captain carter , and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day , as he was going the next morning to london 	119.05195555591939
i hope she will turn out well 	606.2758998541561
the eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty seven , was elizabeth ' s intimate friend 	821.6026703816797
that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done 	123.09145293491447
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? " " what think you of this sentence , my dear lizzy ? " said jane as she finished it 	1157.9370324424629
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them 	417.99726649039036
to all the objections i have already urged , i have still another to add 	1113.6527527775106
" she followed him thither 	177.4108063124959
miss bingley ' s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for jane 	124.13716084838897
" " it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends 	469.3302978063667
i do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain 	227.9858867393042
certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as i was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man 	1321.4412285352444
he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt ' s , where his regret and vexation , and the concern of every body was well talked over 	1800.6506507693348
and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress 	524.9245889079949
" " how can you contrive to write so even ? " he was silent 	111.4250275689968
" " and i certainly never shall give it 	164.52336999842478
" elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham 	215.0318084674943
if you have not been mistaken here , i must have been in an error 	81.65468093330163
i never was 	35.919956073244194
but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life 	905.0699922741094
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them 	670.0489315752527
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them 	90.78964959093719
what an agreeable man sir william is , mr bingley is not he ? so much the man of fashion ! so genteel and so easy ! he has always something to say to every body 	978.0359021424019
mr wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia 	1735.798769326178
thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony 	1269.2412610328506
made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission ! so much the better 	1680.9314614080033
wickham of course wanted more than he could get 	428.6730617326849
" and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family 	37.48287487458226
you know him too well to doubt the rest 	156.34765565617744
" " and mary king is safe ! " added elizabeth 	674.9696047604078
" project gutenberg " is a registered trademark 	12.042528134529222
" " if we thought alike of miss bingley , " replied jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy 	177.94556461169762
and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public 	1610.1147647889798
" if one could but go to brighton ! " observed mrs bennet 	42.578322022948676
mrs bennet could hardly contain herself 	33.71310472801686
his friend had given him the earliest information of it 	197.5029923176235
" no one made any reply 	133.42607711960412
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other 	1444.0261663232775
as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general , was beyond the collinses' reach 	547.4002135598956
she wished , she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them 	311.17320293060385
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty 	635.4310610272174
her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others 	267.3674873335846
at such a distance as that , you know , things are strangely misrepresented 	167.8397774145489
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory 	1004.8584546094951
his attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect 	2300.939312317181
my affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever 	1099.295889492435
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew 	665.4504449918213
and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better 	160.85292898331224
" " perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her 	247.63263557020935
and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly 	26.088937132834744
but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody 	348.0667698161309
and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs bennet ' s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away 	1287.4490786403283
were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express 	243.49150187242043
and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st 	869.0550999067294
he is a gentleman 	8.13649272832024
but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded , unless mr darcy returned within the stated time 	4641.604521137186
but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out 	482.03726424561785
" elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards 	1197.5161590741445
promise me , therefore , to come to hunsford 	153.363136319753
that of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest 	196.46739359873135
very little was said by either 	375.54839448281297
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton 	170.31236624673622
" " but i was embarrassed 	23.772991057895624
and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcy ' s sister , as , by wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away 	1180.391968594965
the subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity 	944.7351038364069
to caroline ' s assertion of her brother ' s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit 	216.88787924094223
i did not expect it from you 	17.97397582916508
elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation 	1919.7925393420896
with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation 	765.880791750613
" after many pauses and many trials of other subjects , elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying , " i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley ! how can mr bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? how can they suit each other ? do you know mr bingley ? " " not at all 	986.2886561570566
for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another 	974.8813612107392
it was impossible not to long to know 	25.825438410252044
" darcy was fixed in astonishment 	179.72389215902282
at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family 	inf
but elizabeth , less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in charlotte ' s , did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence 	1724.045123792911
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart 	698.0937381081877
" said her mother as soon as she was in the hall 	29.811812000968043
" elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together 	140.83448664413797
it is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which i am now complaining 	191.26587367576235
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before 	456.67056198569446
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of miss lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of mrs philips' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation 	436.3713900244873
miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed 	694.5561762249964
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart 	1742.884168904639
i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject 	56.93071176428011
we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured 	329.65240734438396
and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses 	842.7705855051814
only in different lines 	656.9805265861964
so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself 	54.23775622072356
i speak nothing but the truth 	89.01371525053986
do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will 	197.50547948616804
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else 	437.4567437493975
she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body 	575.5661930628632
but before she had been three minutes in her own room , her mother followed her 	319.81558063746627
well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away 	171.36489993802948
" elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing room 	280.65372722902674
and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either 	486.87339731366035
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all 	3160.9654363452205
these are conditions , which , considering every thing , i had no hesitation in complying with , as far as i thought myself privileged , for you 	276.81183267126136
" i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows 	140.89928861733551
mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them 	431.70789588915704
" it keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and i am more obliged to you than i can express 	91.59608539647833
without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object 	4856.7102920862535
his revenge would have been complete indeed 	142.49335354482153
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield 	521.5118174067768
she answered him with cold civility 	24.538562278580287
but really , ma'am , i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early 	942.2109486971829
" " it may do very well for the others , " replied mr bingley 	72.3504962727939
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance 	1447.4873085492918
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word 	114.85740137465007
" " probably not 	77.63901063113842
there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention , while she added , " when i said that he improved on acquaintance , i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood 	2196.953179570919
perhaps he had been civil , only because he felt himself at ease 	453.5345789571433
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr darcy 	345.6692262091352
i remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well wisher and friend , william collins 	3113.417352109244
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first 	147.30717217171446
after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner , and thus began , " in vain have i struggled 	478.65956270272386
though her spirits are greatly shaken 	249.21997369358135
and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain 	260.3184758123443
i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy 	369.71609515946614
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves 	2633.1790246173177
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable 	257.52172376429195

" " certainly not 	3.772830457115691
you know my sentiments 	22.737138107510283
" nothing that she could say , however , had any influence 	117.99212446718931
