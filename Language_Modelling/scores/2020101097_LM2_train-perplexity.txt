uiring of maria across the table , after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter 	2.3734399037523306
" mr bingley arrived 	3.5628787971968228
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley , yet , for elizabeth ' s sake , he assisted him farther in his profession 	2.6941390063213655
poor jane ! i am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately 	2.9161689433618316
elizabeth ' s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome 	2.6260346393182705
" " i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation , " replied elizabeth , " but it is not in my power to accept it 	2.7924666240763547
and oh ! how ardently did she long to know , whether any of his were directed in a like manner 	2.5421028622171105
but whether she were violently set against the match , or violently delighted with it , it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense 	2.4056469237258455
i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it 	2.4501653712469036
he arranges the business just as he pleases 	2.994053374267279
as they went down stairs together , charlotte said , " i shall depend on hearing from you very often , eliza 	2.7344165114409025
they found mary , as usual , deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature 	2.2481267341631437
yet , indeed , i am in earnest 	4.89365750784967
we must not make him desperate 	3.3050204011322073
it was impossible not to long to know 	2.9552809464865186
" " you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , " said mr darcy , looking at the eldest miss bennet 	3.1774247067220815
in a few minutes , mrs bennet half opened the door and called out , " lizzy , my dear , i want to speak with you 	3.1752078065191967
" lady catherine de bourgh , " she replied , " has very lately given him a living 	2.9174544900096024
" " i believe , ma'am , i may safely promise you never to dance with him 	2.707089884234314
" we will ask you no questions 	2.9692326375659834
" " not that i shall though , " she added to herself , as she finished the letter 	3.4763510853990174
" your great men often are 	2.84694555806961
i am most seriously displeased 	3.19662646191918
" and gravely glancing at mr darcy , " there is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with 'keep your breath to cool your porridge ,' and i shall keep mine to swell my song 	2.325044692708862
it was possible , and sometimes she thought it probable , that his affection might be re animated , and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane ' s attractions 	2.755166558217399
" and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you 	3.475057310373256
she felt all the compliment it offered to herself , and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother 	2.6395668058839887
she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances , and she was in no humour to indulge him 	3.0646356517959865
but against this , there were objections 	3.1887619675817906
he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true 	2.4743538017915476
end of the second volume 	4.012494689123025
and had this led to no suspicion , the faces of both as they hastily turned round , and moved away from each other , would have told it all 	2.209440308626147
i was never more annoyed ! the insipidity and yet the noise 	3.2994200902179682
but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts 	3.902019653309835
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father , their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility 	2.6771517693299787
i described , and enforced them earnestly 	4.004828513771613
" " you persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him 	2.563443537958932
that of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest 	3.160541331054913
and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to ramsgate 	2.933754295647355
the rain continued the whole evening without intermission 	2.813131760838327
for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter 	2.5188761694583492
and , allowing for the loss of sir william , and there being only one card table in the evening , every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first 	2.8937738997447764
mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight , but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction 	2.639474760131798
i believe him to be lady catherine ' s nephew 	3.829865869369026
it is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor 	2.453170538843027
" " true 	3.015247554755662
but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough 	2.4536584516446713
not that i care about it , though 	3.5532219780799843
his reception however was of the most flattering kind 	2.980057322252211
but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means 	2.3376187036421383
wished his fair cousins health and happiness again , and promised their father another letter of thanks 	2.6095188174471016
" elizabeth thanked him from her heart , and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying 	2.4703497939372707
sir william staid only a week at hunsford 	2.766758201376045
but i dare say he may spend half his time here 	2.842280220959091
are the others coming out ? " " i do not know 	3.4035440143039
" i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter 	2.4266407958739946
to caroline ' s assertion of her brother ' s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit 	2.704380792104244
she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue , and the mere stateliness of money and rank , she thought she could witness without trepidation 	2.4908270655003464
if there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence 	3.0071875656720053
respect , esteem , and confidence , had vanished for ever 	2.6784220530512233
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together 	2.6695207425391665
" she found that she was to receive no other answer and , after a short pause , added , " i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again ? " " i have never heard him say so 	2.8931393652659705
and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennet ' s being quite unable to sit alone 	2.5022439707131734
promise me , therefore , to come to hunsford 	3.851481358583154
" she was gone directly 	3.4797226223219533
" " let her be called down 	2.7661289257678163
in such an exigence my uncle ' s advice and assistance would be every thing in the world 	2.8188193789516696
" and upon elizabeth ' s seeming really , with vexed and embarrassed looks , about to escape , she added , " lizzy , i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins 	2.26752315226218
" " your list of the common extent of accomplishments , " said darcy , " has too much truth 	2.6629637604984016
but when the gentlemen entered , jane was no longer the first object 	2.9772208405566647
it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom 	3.046593549393593
the compliment to herself and her sister , was not unfelt 	4.485456138652437
but it is all , all too late now 	3.103057236598249
chapter xi 	3.554720655478363
but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity 	2.911820362555042
" " impossible , mr bennet , impossible , when i am not acquainted with him myself 	3.288118477922015

with them he is remarkably agreeable 	2.977013206533088
i hope he will overlook it 	3.5262277860067943
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly 	2.7900789455830233
but he had given a reason for his interference , which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief 	2.271396813595469
i promised them so faithfully ! what will wickham say ? it was to be such a secret ! " " if it was to be secret , " said jane , " say not another word on the subject 	3.019591957810416
" mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt ' s ill breeding , and made no answer 	2.444225351203677
next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then 	2.3485870571665988
mr bennet , in equal silence , was enjoying the scene 	2.9223416694084396
" you want to tell me , and i have no objection to hearing it 	3.777153846414425
he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which , in spite of all his endeavours , he had found impossible to conquer 	3.180934086247587
and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air , with such a companion 	2.562568079364065
" " what , none of you ? " " not one 	3.4395675269264365
i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman 	3.9057905505520973
of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant 	3.253776986378765
elizabeth , as she affectionately embraced her , whilst tears filled the eyes of both , lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives 	2.5139847829933326
" words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings 	3.573911455839749
it cannot be concealed from any one 	3.1330736436118567
it amazes me , i confess 	4.3951556751181515
pemberley was now georgiana ' s home 	3.0231247645090638
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn 	2.7698900918892595
in this danger kitty is also comprehended 	2.784094193381233
" " insolent girl ! " said elizabeth to herself 	3.256461908662473
" " i see no occasion for that 	2.9819282792407806
" " it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first 	2.280358678812513
and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice , and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed 	2.7937121406363272
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley , and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well 	2.51649712536117
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman , not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet 	2.6074602084905556
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley ' s dislike of her had originated in jealousy , she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her , and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady ' s side , the acquaintance would now be renewed 	2.5331218316935025
let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers 	3.1160116591426443
nor did he seem much more at ease 	2.6434400778238
i knew nothing at all of lady catherine ' s connections 	3.3853842951722024
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error , and seek to clear one , without involving the other 	2.7406326934125365
" if , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , " she added , " i shall know how to understand it 	2.7354469876689347
and though prepared , as he told elizabeth , to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house , he was used to be free from them there 	2.5510242997782178
and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards 	2.5402167057518263
the latter was thinking only of his breakfast 	2.6827246455221956
" lady catherine seemed resigned 	3.257552860181669
" " that is capital , " added her sister , and they both laughed heartily 	3.1508414700237553
in town i believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation 	2.4360986761921573
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye , she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight , diffused over his face , became him 	2.291182640263176
" she is my youngest girl but one 	2.845731354186665
the promised letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday , addressed to their father , and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth ' s abode in the family might have prompted 	2.281486065745101
" " and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry ? did he know of their intending to go off ? had colonel forster seen denny himself ? " " yes 	2.0566129947468696
but when they see , as i trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again 	2.680013859992176
and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas 	2.5654573241767404
and as to the loss of their society , she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it , in the enjoyment of his 	2.974157609687292
after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight , and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her , the visitor did at last appear 	2.5418073567762898
whenever she was alone , she gave way to it as the greatest relief 	2.903377574712604
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship , in spite of a great opposition of character 	2.829072964137256
at least , therefore , i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies 	3.0084819950051873
for , if i recollect right , he went but the day before 	2.849214874376595
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight 	2.501293098070912
no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard 	2.5951106620737514
amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet , whose dislike of his general behaviour , was sharpened into particular resentment , by his having slighted one of her daughters 	2.529123515991453
i hope they will not meet at all 	2.986268417487909
after going over so many , she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains 	2.4943851533076082
mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public 	2.764172823690596
for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction 	3.3352251338564525
" " oh ! no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both 	2.2350910074301398
" " but , my dear , you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood 	2.5946053870877632
and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been 	2.8659776128637846
mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure , and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming , when she found herself so affectionately received 	2.5146556883529962
" they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas 	2.58684194187051
what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory , and as she recalled his very words , it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other 	2.9092099469690877
" oh , jane , take care 	3.210148434007274
on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects 	2.319635426010996
she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to her , and more teazing than usual to himself 	3.194256124626283
i thought him very sly 	3.1458799935367625
" she would not give him time to reply , but hurrying instantly to her husband , called out as she entered the library , " oh ! mr bennet , you are wanted immediately 	3.01696618196524
" " in what an amiable light does this place him ! " thought elizabeth 	2.3408349533853854
he promises fairly , and i hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent 	2.60391389645362
the coach , therefore , took them the first stage of their journey , and brought its master back to longbourn 	2.9405126643106354
but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this 	2.186297628201715
you know my mother ' s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends 	2.926955938403299
but , however , he is very welcome to come to netherfield , if he likes it 	3.41424223224561
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself 	2.724093332821567
" nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance 	2.4137214012186017
had his own happiness , however , been the only sacrifice , he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best 	2.794591823486679
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement 	3.162608241317929
but when he went away , the whole family returned to their usual employments , and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration , for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden , or in reading and writing , and looking out of window in his own book room , which fronted the road 	2.3241922478522827
chapter v 	3.795770813013684
" " some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me 	2.748534632442125
when first he came in , he had spoken to her but little 	2.8508166315741468
i should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing 	2.9962188238568706
you have liked many a stupider person 	3.005331161584701
her ladyship received them civilly , but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else 	2.4325097368818906
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased 	2.1564275413455714
" " what do you mean ? " " why , i must confess , that i love him better than i do bingley 	3.1425601027384027
it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure , because on such occasions it is the etiquette 	2.4235237883731027
and if you will stay another month complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london , for i am going there early in june , for a week 	2.9824654581490506
and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , i have not yet learnt to condemn them 	2.345412473684788
" we may as well leave them by themselves you know 	2.6068797360026483
she was disappointed , and angry with herself for being so 	2.483148389173868
and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view , as he meant to chuse one of the daughters , if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report 	2.7543503099563127
he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re establish a character 	2.6042686152831527

mrs collins , seeing that she was really unwell , did not press her to go , and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her , but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine ' s being rather displeased by her staying at home 	2.5569078636612326
" " you shall have it in few words 	2.5553250978891744
or me either , for that matter 	3.124567369003009

and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way 	2.4138653145814923
what a good joke it will be ! i can hardly write for laughing 	3.012522688290299
lady catherine de bourgh ' s attention to his wishes , and consideration for his comfort , appeared very remarkable 	2.4294032884641665
but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal 	2.32512675373542
he took the hint , and when mary had finished her second song , said aloud , " that will do extremely well , child 	2.479744545509414

let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance 	2.7205979216827356
mrs long said so too , for i asked her whether you did not 	2.716197593940955
" this was not very consoling to mrs bennet , and , therefore , instead of making any answer , she went on as before , " i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate 	3.4538091544603553
" " my dearest sister , now be be serious 	2.6412356033262596

this he considered sufficient encouragement , and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her , immediately followed 	3.0963087110150798
" mr gardiner added in his letter , that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day , which was saturday 	2.7859459400177173
but she , who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible , gaily continued , " oh ! mamma , do the people here abouts know i am married to day ? i was afraid they might not 	2.6798542461193122
it is enough to know they are discovered , i have seen them both " " then it is , as i always hoped , " cried jane 	2.998182182224417

there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley , that could provoke his ridicule , or disgust him into silence 	2.3747556540831773
her father was walking about the room , looking grave and anxious 	3.0702222093130342
" gracechurch street , sept 	3.573357414239702
she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas 	3.0294725869113845

" my dear mr bennet , " said his lady to him one day , " have you heard that netherfield park is let at last ? " mr bennet replied that he had not 	2.852933891066675
but it must be done soon 	3.789838687438649
" miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face , and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections 	2.2492690920568683
" my mind however is now made up on the subject , for having received ordination at easter , i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh , widow of sir lewis de bourgh , whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish , where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship , and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england 	2.4493788318066314

indeed , eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them 	2.965673269695377
they saw him often , and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve 	2.886485110991583
he drew a chair near her 	2.872973804040042
the world has been deceived in that respect 	2.900344802375206
and in the wretched state of his own finances , there was a very powerful motive for secrecy , in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia ' s relations , for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him , to a very considerable amount 	2.6647609456774997

and his behaviour , so strikingly altered , what could it mean ? that he should even speak to her was amazing ! but to speak with such civility , to enquire after her family ! never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified , never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting 	2.0121420629416615

while his sisters , convinced that no country advice could be of any service , recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians 	2.3188153691397244
and , according to the present plan , were to go no farther northward than derbyshire 	2.7289106877112808
his being such a charming young man , and so rich , and living but three miles from them , were the first points of self gratulation 	2.579845093163922

they will never be distressed for money 	2.92152337253183
she felt it so 	3.6380528976539948
she looked at jane , to see how she bore it 	2.977355196822572
" no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth , and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful 	2.9324585884845478
" " oh , well ! it is just as he chooses 	2.7752550581474114
i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish 	2.4117505856103785
it cannot be done too much 	3.2236674044754783
" " very true , indeed 	2.9925831638836438

" " could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia ' s note to his wife ? " " he brought it with him for us to see 	2.876289164677692
" indeed you have no reason 	3.884037441407691
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related 	2.6945869129840356
and she was perpetually either making some inquiry , or looking at his page 	2.8002983962494845
" i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town 	2.5553087890972437
that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match 	4.050363809448298
mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once 	2.723667397946123
he dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday 	2.9083898033209343
he did trace them easily to clapham , but no farther 	2.6130658562216333
and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment 	2.9426783561440875
the present unhappy state of the family , rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary 	3.0472777430746043
on the strength of darcy ' s regard bingley had the firmest reliance , and of his judgment the highest opinion 	2.92924394917823
and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably , when the sound of horses drew their notice , and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street 	2.481345558265379
mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune , which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day 	2.285508357651675
my temper would perhaps be called resentful 	2.6989664470129107
after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour , without hearing miss bingley ' s voice , elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family 	2.2789239026222643
" what do you think ? it is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like 	2.2245113897621063
and had i been the rector of longbourn , i should very strenuously have opposed it 	2.722765421499
" " yes 	2.6895785044543086
it was evident that he was very much in love with her 	3.5244796920644106
not that i am afraid of myself , but i dread other people ' s remarks 	3.4405212950353863
but if he wished to converse with her , he might have better success 	2.998782701493404
i believe i have now told you every thing 	2.8047032064209776
he was resolutely silent however 	3.577026479828725
the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable , gentleman like set , and the best of them were of the present party 	3.0428525705976646
but the case is this 	3.346010847754454
yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him , and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece ' s beginning the subject 	3.2740319758984304

she performed her part indeed without much graciousness , but mrs bennet was satisfied , and soon afterwards ordered her carriage 	2.8910803124028064
mrs bennet , with great civility , begged her ladyship to take some refreshment 	2.656318640162075
amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment 	2.1719665310977168
but with respect to any other leading characteristic , i do not imagine that much has been unfolded 	3.2218445195272474
and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley , to assure him how happy he would make them , by eating a family dinner with them at any time , without the ceremony of a formal invitation 	2.704422110058445
you are safe from me 	3.172055624174714
at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy , with such a smile over the face , as she remembered to have sometimes seen , when he looked at her 	2.9145023183790646
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage , explained to her that , by his wife at least , if not by himself , such a hope was cherished 	2.530974605092388
" " your first position is false 	2.9335657501163466
but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them 	2.51522807538547
his doing so drew her notice 	2.816573287881221
while the family were in this confusion , charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them 	2.4956965964090627
but mr bennet was firm : it soon led to another 	2.601533126750955
and you must feel , as well as i do , that the woman who marries him , cannot have a proper way of thinking 	2.858606943971016
for she was in no cheerful humour 	3.3844308989700176
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared 	2.6259012395422308
" my dear lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? " was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room , and from all the others when they sat down to table 	2.7454370729788704
he was directly invited to join their party , but he declined it , observing , that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together , with either of which motives his joining them would interfere 	2.1829541367839593
" well , mamma , " said she , when they were all returned to the breakfast room , " and what do you think of my husband ? is not he a charming man ? i am sure my sisters must all envy me 	2.9881897377741087
" " yes , sir , i know i am 	3.337602015683109
ever since i have known it , i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it 	3.0397183384582847
ii 	5.727374821554181
" when lydia went away , she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty 	2.485276768355376
lydia ' s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter 	2.939083546707074
and luckily for the others , the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company 	2.4984156512404643
who is to fight wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? " as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home , it was settled that she and her children should go to london , at the same time that mr bennet came from it 	2.9338887727595915
the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow 	2.3507705798095055
i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not 	2.9204978925569325
" " my motive for cautioning you , is as follows 	2.735248780202716
she could not think of darcy ' s leaving kent , without remembering that his cousin was to go with him 	3.2641387806143536
he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire , and jane and elizabeth , in addition to every other source of happiness , were within thirty miles of each other 	2.6745932009564277
i mend pens remarkably well 	3.0251693479149724
" " oh ! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! and , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road 	2.6417849304549046
" " thank you , " said lydia , " for if you did , i should certainly tell you all , and then wickham would be angry 	3.40744487178441
bingley met them with hopes that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected 	2.529280805215327
" you forget that i have made no answer 	3.029453068822801
for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all 	2.892204393795584
" as he spoke there was a sort of smile , which elizabeth fancied she understood 	2.9249841694633925
" " i am grieved , indeed , " cried darcy 	3.42183187070011
well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better 	2.8774974580771304
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell , but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you 	2.5415372307303294
but the grounds are delightful 	3.087039653142649
and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend 	2.9636612282786596
" my dear , dear lydia ! " she cried : " this is delightful indeed ! she will be married ! i shall see her again ! she will be married at sixteen ! my good , kind brother ! i knew how it would be i knew he would manage every thing 	2.290513174679266
he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , wickham repeatedly , lydia once 	2.7718688643883858
she continued to declare that she would , and the argument ended only with the visit 	3.2771756757979698
" you have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! unfeeling , selfish girl ! do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? " " lady catherine , i have nothing farther to say 	2.8722446359569838
" as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not , she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind 	2.110405741285216
and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married 	2.0956895996437264
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of , she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours 	2.6498420661680138
but if otherwise , if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural , in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object , and even before two words have been exchanged , nothing can be said in her defence , except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method , in her partiality for wickham , and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment 	2.3771005838857673
mrs wickham ! how well it sounds 	2.9363286230167875
did you see it ? " bingley replied that he did , and made his congratulations 	3.1270117222464524
but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him 	2.4865751424067866
she comes to us to day 	3.0009629623946954
but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply 	3.093859502436817
" " complied with ! i am only ashamed of his asking so little 	2.7725842179544045
" you used us abominably ill , " answered mrs hurst , " in running away without telling us that you were coming out 	2.3054058729192928
she has two nieces of her own 	3.333989759825907
i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children 	3.3870043492378565
his attachment excited gratitude , his general character respect 	2.5485045603435776
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was 	2.459458515600888
the rooms were lofty and handsome , and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor 	2.5003184054611003
but my dearest love , tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of , that i may have it to morrow 	2.639379333109346
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman , and required information 	2.226919413329576
" are you not diverted ? " " oh ! yes 	3.635152081806125
i am perfectly satisfied 	3.5946563983642204
kitty simpered and smiled , and hoped her turn was coming soon 	2.6674649506732906
they attacked him in various ways 	3.234120742412017
she longed to see mrs philips , the lucases , and all their other neighbours , and to hear herself called " mrs wickham , " by each of them 	2.718238975544787
and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself 	2.219897872848635
" " whatever my connections may be , " said elizabeth , " if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to you 	2.8185803924067128
" " you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy ? " " indeed i am 	3.3858116761392822
she became jealous of his esteem , when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it 	2.7505812080244163
imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland 	2.1808861836842452
then , the two third he danced with miss king , and the two fourth with maria lucas , and the two fifth with jane again , and the two sixth with lizzy , and the boulanger " " if he had had any compassion for me , " cried her husband impatiently , " he would not have danced half so much ! for god ' s sake , say no more of his partners 	3.0175933537291377
mrs collins will be very glad of your company , i am sure 	3.1241958903396303
and she made the most of the time , by visiting about with her daughter , and having very frequent parties at home 	2.581932881592082
and in their brother ' s manners there was something better than politeness 	2.849584299715558
you mentioned two instances 	3.3690040567741235
" he is certainly a good brother , " said elizabeth , as she walked towards one of the windows 	3.6177146029922893
he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter , he had never seen a more elegant woman 	2.945297887236283
" they will join me early to morrow , " he continued , " and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you , mr bingley and his sisters 	2.6990412272784448
and she lay awake two whole hours , endeavouring to make them out 	2.4570997524287423
every body had been most kind and attentive to him , there had been no formality , no stiffness , he had soon felt acquainted with all the room 	3.0285734564780817
but elizabeth heard not a word , and , wholly engrossed by her own feelings , followed them in silence 	2.745320191891103
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner 	3.606662790160622
when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match 	2.3920281977180116
and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister 	2.2276034884122415
i 	4.956466675950868
mrs bennet ' s best comfort was , that mr bingley must be down again in the summer 	2.7278783088159893
but , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her 	2.5962524176477837
and their mother talked on , of her dislike of mr darcy , and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingley ' s friend , without being heard by either of them 	2.8577785183634195
" " can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? " " yes 	2.291765629451241
chapter xii 	2.740340420276896
" " but i hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood 	2.481807824621196
it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected 	2.254336349467452
you know him too well to doubt the rest 	2.827860013168975
" " yes 	2.6895785044543086
i am truly glad , dearest lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes 	2.843925095953973
she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcy that mr darcy might leave the country , but that he should stand his ground 	2.9955481243738884
" elizabeth was surprised , but agreed to it immediately 	2.614626722783779
but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance 	3.1159732183955886
and mr gardiner , after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family , told her that he meant to be in london the very next day , and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia 	2.6835537321111893
it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side 	2.706611215653863
elizabeth made no answer , and took her place in the set , amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy , and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it 	2.4195594889329386
but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear 	3.426170895016795
and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time 	2.178102473094576
and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman 	2.4062548606168463
they were soon gone again , rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise , and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennet ' s civilities 	2.0302473511566492
i wonder when you would have spoken , if i had not asked you ! my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect 	2.368235598973396
" and will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? " " i will make no promise of the kind 	2.626707465120973
he then said , " i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly 	3.0387360964136465
elizabeth was surprised , but said not a word 	2.9053328635604028
but darcy , at whom it was all aimed , was still inflexibly studious 	3.5623123423426524
" " you have said quite enough , madam 	2.6170962521226366

there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them , for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam , the younger son of his uncle , lord and to the great surprise of all the party , when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him 	2.627721043843439
and within four hours of their leaving hunsford , they reached mr gardiner ' s house , where they were to remain a few days 	2.706246276227092
" " mr bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? you take delight in vexing me 	2.962921326114735

but there are two things that i want very much to know : one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about 	2.0491610086058354
" i know little of the game , at present , " said he , " but i shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life " mrs philips was very thankful for his compliance , but could not wait for his reason 	2.5750690797250853
are you going much farther ? " " no , i should have turned in a moment 	3.2168169564945597
they were able to love each other , even as well as they intended 	3.0491571910172905
had it been your uncle ' s doing , i must and would have paid him 	2.9817017400224346
told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her ' s , and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry 	3.5082174780574755
and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send 	2.648509429441428
her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and i remained convinced from the evening ' s scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment 	2.5620418998521752
this cannot be ! engaged to mr darcy ! no , no , you shall not deceive me 	3.142374026916927
and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark 	2.3981470610383706
bingley was quite uncomfortable 	3.553093376696199
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece 	2.7841377339835693
and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park , hurried home with the great intelligence 	2.30742490245441
after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room , from the sideboard to the fender , to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london , mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden , which was large and well laid out , and to the cultivation of which he attended himself 	3.4357655221905126
four weeks passed away , and jane saw nothing of him 	2.9968089232288615
elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately 	2.958482111726753
it drew from her , however , the exertion of speaking , which nothing else had so effectually done before 	2.600075095304956
and it was certain , that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one , whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own , his aunt would address him on his weakest side 	2.549417982664804
and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister , and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself , she was very little disposed to approve them 	2.8837708427377895
if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless , you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin 	2.7115183428791414

mr wickham began the subject himself 	2.9683736976242514
for though dilatory in undertaking business , he was quick in its execution 	3.176692183665933
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned , brought on a headache 	2.5735686457538347

lydia ' s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband ' s never intending to go there himself 	2.58223456040529
" " dear madam , " cried mrs hill , in great astonishment , " don't you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner ? he has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter 	2.2343631105759476
against staying longer , however , elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked 	3.2848608755347866
" " go , my dear , " cried her mother , " and shew her ladyship about the different walks 	2.7669686170150767
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcy ' s delight , when she should enter the room 	3.078394105989196
there is one point , on which i want your advice 	2.847015185704846
the latter of whom , however , could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of all miss bingley ' s witticisms on fine _ 	3.4903208663976897
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great 	3.5367102715215903
let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest 	2.837436872059951
when mr collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed , which certainly was not unseldom , she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte 	2.644540388101504
colonel fitzwilliam , who led the way , was about thirty , not handsome , but in person and address most truly the gentleman 	2.2717573672508666
but bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own 	2.546624357667185
and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army 	2.2526356572133666
and mrs forster , and kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns 	2.875741536447857
she coloured as she spoke 	3.3355392726580706

the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic 	2.5498457575675415

to be sure london was rather thin , but however the little theatre was open 	2.380368126973347
he owns it himself without disguise 	2.786856341897977
when the ladies removed after dinner , elizabeth ran up to her sister , and seeing her well guarded from cold , attended her into the drawing room 	2.4619522011942876
it came from netherfield , and was opened immediately 	3.7766121074527366
the sisters , on hearing this , repeated three or four times how much they were grieved , how shocking it was to have a bad cold , and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves 	2.1943463097789158
so i will dictate , and you write for me 	4.1749750780112835
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper 	2.9388567049794436
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her , she saw nothing in it really to lament 	3.341920753818681
and you saw the old housekeeper , i suppose ? poor reynolds , she was always very fond of me 	2.6911471716520703
for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him , i should only think worse of her understanding , than i now do of her heart 	2.3955488863181187
i do not trust my own partiality 	3.0287645795248417
lizzy is not a bit better than the others 	2.9637238350499007

she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject , and related , with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration , the shocking rudeness of mr darcy 	2.8469663283065128
if i can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too 	2.9799823098087765
a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word 	2.539590900344982
but at length was reduced to be reasonable 	2.585777732169753
and before she could strike into another path , she was overtaken by wickham 	3.2585892205883225

though it was not put in as it ought to be 	3.267097022810265
but really , and upon my honour , i will try to do what i think to be wisest 	2.6259443023957347
to my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men 	3.002820079600155
" " yes , " replied darcy , who could contain himself no longer , " but that was only when i first knew her , for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance 	2.683511474142966
the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance 	3.3681997869947007
you will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him 	3.0128843569895314
is this to be endured ! but it must not , shall not be 	3.0490095472475494
her brother ' s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour : his judgment could not err , and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth , as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable 	2.6779971702534335
" she wrote again when the visit was paid , and she had seen miss bingley 	2.981341397909644
but what could set you off in the first place ? " " i cannot fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation 	2.677299932718003
" indeed , mr bennet , " said she , " it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that i should be forced to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it ! " " my dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts 	3.0327780763562417

i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier 	2.3819913112652507
she was not equal , however , to much conversation , and when miss bingley left them together , could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with 	2.3650087099572263
" " i am not one and twenty 	2.8737970586983757
mr wickham ' s chief object was unquestionably my sister ' s fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds 	2.9862758072528526
they saw much to interest , but nothing to justify enquiry 	2.542339313597994
kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do 	2.7035808019641427
i enquired after their brother , of course 	3.090526754239186
he comes down on thursday at the latest , very likely on wednesday 	3.0433349700829457
such i was , from eight to eight and twenty 	2.502350211996923
you are lucky in having such a master 	2.7761355152117084

bingley is most unaffectedly modest 	3.627589457231379
the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch 	2.896171186008054
and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , i am sure , to oblige us for one half hour 	2.5076473511388238

vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled ! oh ! my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? " mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject 	2.518206905893139
vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously 	2.4464652180642927
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew 	3.2974185528460644
it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth 	2.4745493047609957
my father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be 	2.4854276008461835
and so , my dear sister , i find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen pemberley 	3.12523012295785
and was so good as to stay till thursday with me 	2.6832661226919194
i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses 	2.700563266657233
elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness , with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal 	2.46281077919453
" you provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing ( or by e mail ) within <num> days of receipt that s/he does not agree to the terms of the full project gutenberg tm license 	2.159727704141706
you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness 	2.606959595702597
as for their mother , mr collins ' s letter had done away much of her ill will , and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure , which astonished her husband and daughters 	2.79612973500681
<num>	4.24676143746824
a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given , but it could not be kept without difficulty 	2.8169996414722274
in as short a time as mr collins ' s long speeches would allow , every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both 	2.7664735613838993
though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy 	2.4670479443963376
as they passed through the hall , lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room , and pronouncing them , after a short survey , to be decent looking rooms , walked on 	2.9773100941745443
maria thought speaking out of the question , and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire 	3.218839768412511
it was mr collins ' s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened 	2.6764417116702
" elizabeth looked surprised 	3.348766630805694
i thought i should have died 	3.5092795391363802
there was certainly at this moment , in elizabeth ' s mind , a more gentle sensation towards the original , than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance 	2.41562682023774
" your affectionate friend , " lydia bennet 	2.8215698945947243
i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage 	2.8287618611160523
i am so grieved for him 	3.0736450362247485
till this moment , i never knew myself 	3.5032827226169143
pride and prejudice : a novel 	2.673451814343777
but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother ' s proposal 	3.5721074855190103
but she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies 	2.682842367135177
" " do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? " " sometimes 	2.777671401323988
" " in such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of 	2.6429461467240465
" during their walk , it was resolved that mr bennet ' s consent should be asked in the course of the evening 	2.74726006188253
" as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession 	3.1769833759931903
" oh , lizzy ! it cannot be 	3.510300269341447
" do you prefer reading to cards ? " said he 	2.806698425632581

<num>	4.24676143746824
but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed 	2.745899535286229
sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before 	2.792432197406971
you must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last 	2.4215674022404703
they walked on , without knowing in what direction 	3.0541426976790897
and their conversation , which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children , was now put an end to , by the approach of the whole party 	2.628243542245801
in three volumes 	3.035429261304607
" her performance was pleasing , though by no means capital 	2.742977228080343
but i have always observed , that they who are good natured when children , are good natured when they grow up 	2.3672995201376374
" could i expect it to be otherwise ! " said she 	3.2571491914868846
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia , and , removed from the influence of lydia ' s example , she became , by proper attention and management , less irritable , less ignorant , and less insipid 	2.341078861731804
" and pray what is the result ? " " i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect 	3.2245664808796772
" i do , indeed , " replied elizabeth , colouring 	3.700793235735465
what relates to yourself , is as follows 	2.6934449145140373
and , after giving each of them an hasty kiss , hurried into the vestibule , where jane , who came running down stairs from her mother ' s apartment , immediately met her 	2.2778417799830653
but no , " recollecting herself , " that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : i should not have been allowed to invite them 	2.813721541828545
mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty 	2.5200482586266046
[ illustration : morning dress 	2.8529326310534655
" " and of your infliction , " cried elizabeth with energy 	3.923676108330372
but are you pleased , jane ? shall you like to have such a brother ? " " very , very much 	2.8965456799651297
" " you did ! and it was not wholly without foundation 	3.185559391942933
and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william ' s in his regimentals 	2.3966813593489364
these parties were acceptable to all 	2.9395028079986742
she was less handsome than her brother , but there was sense and good humour in her face , and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle 	2.73573511977527
but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else 	2.5050134343944137
they are even impartial towards miss king 	2.666929330619828
" and they are really to be married ! " cried elizabeth , as soon as they were by themselves 	3.486523317154193
but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time , she had the same story to repeat every day 	3.2218500417953204
and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better 	2.431556951227783
those that best pleased her , as placing his conduct in the noblest light , seemed most improbable 	2.692297492981768

but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield 	2.565442608999488
in comparing her recollection of pemberley , with the minute description which wickham could give , and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor , she was delighting both him and herself 	2.801678988774911
there can be no love in all this 	3.2147389392039476
the apothecary came , and having examined his patient , said , as might be supposed , that she had caught a violent cold , and that they must endeavour to get the better of it 	3.049034135773001
" pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , " cried colonel fitzwilliam 	2.960181372535696
he is the kind of man , indeed , to whom i should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask 	3.0977923330875727
if that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon 	3.489411738375491
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least 	2.3945586442550075
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had , from the distress of the moment , been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister 	2.449451308413872
i will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at longbourn 	2.6264823076997503
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her , and pronounced her to be a sweet girl , and one whom they should not object to know more of 	2.7797831676158355
he scarcely ever spoke to her , and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself , were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas , whose civility in listening to him , was a seasonable relief to them all , and especially to her friend 	3.4048819654429536
she had never heard of his having had any relations , except a father and mother , both of whom had been dead many years 	2.3169575159347384
but as he took up his abode with the lucases , his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet 	2.254839333016811
" " my dear , you flatter me 	2.8921851201914643
he still loves me , and we are engaged 	4.0650745643781425
" i wonder , " said he , at the next opportunity of speaking , " whether he is likely to be in this country much longer 	3.055334305446866
but , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out 	2.72053097768368
in his present behaviour to herself , moreover , she had a fresh source of displeasure , for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance , could only serve , after what had since passed , to provoke her 	2.473918614451184
and he found in mrs philips a very attentive listener , whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard , and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could 	2.5003324539243628
and if you are not kind to us , brother , i do not know what we shall do 	3.1884496671984235
" my dear friend , " if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day ' s tête à tête between two women can never end without a quarrel 	2.4982445480420705
but vanity , not love , has been my folly 	2.8307119751028407
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane 	2.4710674819986407
and i should have gone so all the way , if kitty had not been sick 	3.2507466650275694
" elizabeth took the letter from his writing table , and they went up stairs together 	2.9422712759065313
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject 	2.6836546561882386
but , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother ' s 	2.7978748752962064
her coming there was the most unfortunate , the most ill judged thing in the world ! how strange must it appear to him ! in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man ! it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again ! oh ! why did she come ? or , why did he thus come a day before he was expected ? had they been only ten minutes sooner , they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination , for it was plain that he was that moment arrived , that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage 	2.1445826909982033
for jealousy had not yet made her desperate , and her attentions to mr darcy were by no means over 	2.965310404653142
mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid , who continued , though slowly , to mend 	2.8092051597665293
did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in kent ? " " i have heard from authority , which i thought as _ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron 	2.7099257484578696
no 	5.843892844168918
mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance 	2.202200928500691
but here he was set right by mrs bennet , who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook , and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen 	3.1619365747511714
***end of the project gutenberg ebook pride and prejudice*** ******* this file should be named <num> <num>	3.289554234677692
mrs hurst sang with her sister , and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument , how frequently mr darcy ' s eyes were fixed on her 	2.466818280088258
" and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield , i should probably be off in five minutes 	2.568322424715472
she is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and i have no opinion of her 	3.5208925273218052
but when they had crossed the bridge , and perceived their distance from the house , mrs gardiner , who was not a great walker , could go no farther , and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible 	2.5883442623422055
the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives , and elizabeth continued her walk alone , crossing field after field at a quick pace , jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity , and finding herself at last within view of the house , with weary ancles , dirty stockings , and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise 	3.13006049722951
" while they were dressing , he came two or three times to their different doors , to recommend their being quick , as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner 	2.252509149506713
i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here 	2.12540527122519
jane ran to her uncle and aunt , and welcomed and thanked them both , with alternate smiles and tears 	2.820503857502833
and when she wrote again , elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys 	2.9857983896369134
if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach 	2.388330254508351
the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour , and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of 	2.340054348892258
well , i was so frightened i did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away 	3.4018700605718486
at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here 	2.580327464478951
but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other , of whom , however , she could only tell her nieces what they already knew , that mr denny had brought him from london , and that he was to have a lieutenant ' s commission in the shire 	2.8065310355275495
oh ! that i had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone 	2.742177678980785
every park has its beauty and its prospects 	2.5559509470911586
you and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , mr bingley might like you the best of the party 	2.4581795435414207
but i believe we must abide by our original plan 	2.811483086019259
neither did the apothecary , who arrived about the same time , think it at all advisable 	3.030550564555193
so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as your'_ seems to have been 	3.5492472064770424
" i see what you are feeling , " replied charlotte , " you must be surprised , very much surprised , so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you 	3.0378665585485303
we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton 	2.5112931517887054
" " i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one 	2.7758454708528806
" oh ! my dear lydia , " she cried , " when shall we meet again ? " " oh , lord ! i don't know 	2.933801630197419
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected 	2.6162898558567496
and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned , and preparing her to be surprised , she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself 	2.6760837582393404
mr bennet accepted the challenge , observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements 	2.368587296454882
in the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron 	3.0697916897995308
the party did not supply much conversation 	2.7791286149969676
to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation , had miss lydia bennet come upon the town 	2.8764377107305648
it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy 	2.7986518254688044
do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent 	2.801060987870538
" " and what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? " " my father is gone to london , and jane has written to beg my uncle ' s immediate assistance , and we shall be off , i hope , in half an hour 	2.665278735425862
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent 	2.488182800675514
" " i am sure i shall break mine , " said lydia 	3.6819602282309916
well , colonel fitzwilliam , what do i play next ? my fingers wait your orders 	2.426401929929772
mary ' s powers were by no means fitted for such a display 	2.8023682122612406
don't think me angry , however , for i only mean to let you know , that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side 	2.7982545039663043
all was acknowledged , and half the night spent in conversation 	2.582917818365488
" he answered her in the same style , and the subject dropped 	3.8340717416727355
but as to your other objection , i am afraid it will hardly hold good 	2.911694504065688
from what he said of miss darcy , i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl 	2.9989838586340634
no sooner did he appear , than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed 	2.4304429469177506
you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me 	2.4249428919836777
" when the gentlemen had joined them , and tea was over , the card tables were placed 	2.6721749912596233
" " oh ! do not repeat what i then said 	2.523878452446602
but here , she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character , for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness , and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet 	2.6369762087422313
" " lady catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , " added charlotte , " and a most attentive neighbour 	2.8355743315022446
he was writing , and , without raising his head , coolly replied , " just as you please 	3.0423610210169603
and with many men , i dare say , it succeeds 	3.3489534655440822
" there has been many a one , i fancy , overcome in the same way 	2.717036624902851
good bye 	4.619399679576384
she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither 	2.679712552159771
" " i should take him , even on my slight acquaintance , to be an ill tempered man 	2.533972671929106
that the young man ' s marrying her , was a patched up business , at the expence of your father and uncles 	2.911091424836329
" " it is well 	3.2514292516811287
other schemes too came into her head 	2.794345530635282
if he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , i shall soon cease to regret him at all 	2.8420052175794073
it is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess 	3.238759113280077
my excellent father died about five years ago 	2.5537236994119468
he drew back his chair , took a newspaper from the table , and , glancing over it , said , in a colder voice , " are you pleased with kent ? " a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued , on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister , just returned from their walk 	2.72948806344769
and lastly , it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister , that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked 	3.0775426040626472
and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire 	2.4899088564331393
" " yes , in conjunction with his friend 	3.392009657553234
she listened most attentively to all that passed between them , and gloried in every expression , every sentence of her uncle , which marked his intelligence , his taste , or his good manners 	2.83661008808974
as the day of his arrival drew near , " i begin to be sorry that he comes at all , " said jane to her sister 	3.383309434161073
if i were not afraid of judging harshly , i should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this 	3.617076820996034
that his two sisters and mr darcy , however , should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough , and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman , or the insolent smiles of the ladies , were more intolerable 	3.1052011526726107
as they walked home , elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen 	2.891530746929317
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman 	2.9765916773422845
lydia was lydia still 	3.3546389513571877
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match 	3.2923234795901575
" " i had much rather go in the coach 	2.5154934146895847
that had his actions been what wickham represented them , so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world 	2.9074623607455288
and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood 	3.260442954117757
" well , well , " said he , " do not make yourself unhappy 	3.3003511649401784
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage , for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane , in order to have the earliest assurance of it 	2.5488997904420545
but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence 	2.5508007946066047
she declared her resolution 	3.501991336057923
" " no " said darcy , " i have made no such pretension 	3.3666759167237537
but i hope this may be false 	3.1132669545607463
if elizabeth , when mr darcy gave her the letter , did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers , she had formed no expectation at all of its contents 	2.727515198400869
" " i think i have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in meryton 	3.01938460714801
the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion 	3.140753916627075
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited 	2.3838376702131825
that he has neither integrity nor honour 	3.191213136233199
the motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham ' s worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him 	2.725348472396903
mr darcy ' s behaviour astonished and vexed her 	3.147105394381457
if you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up 	3.6834609191127914
" " oh ! " cried miss bingley , " charles writes in the most careless way imaginable 	3.4339629063156836
he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying 	3.235528747323561
mrs collins , did i tell you of lady metcalfe ' s calling yesterday to thank me ? she finds miss pope a treasure 	2.5255771078373863
i write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , cannot be too soon forgotten 	3.212596253012672
he had felt their importance in the family circle 	3.179507323914323
and when i returned home , the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight ' s time 	2.2591081844278937
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister , or say half that remained to be said , for the present 	3.1237587767210293
" miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming , without changing colour 	3.6992598360334337
but this is the true one 	3.518510642467128
that reply will do for the present 	3.153646056797002
and the others were to meet us at the church 	2.8866111087570197
every body says that he is ate up with pride , and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise 	2.857974914207275
and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us 	2.9935129881378484
all connection between us seemed now dissolved 	2.764523621057215
" you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this 	2.5909764492999465
" " i must not decide on my own performance 	2.5580767907069197
younger sons cannot marry where they like 	2.86976278563637
my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room 	2.5903603324423248
" i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness 	2.4572044460485687
but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings was , and who was its proprietor , when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine ' s drawing rooms , and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds , she felt all the force of the compliment , and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper ' s room 	2.2013313472127463
and pray , lizzy , what said lady catherine about this report ? did she call to refuse her consent ? " to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh 	2.094918045025208
bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life 	2.63677075078673
of the lady ' s sensations they remained a little in doubt 	2.719632290843552
he was exactly what he had been , when i knew him in hertfordshire 	3.670950078390415
" can this be mr darcy ! " thought she 	3.0881192924254908
she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you 	2.8313788566285845
you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble 	2.6852821145614847
i speak nothing but the truth 	3.2640440754494207
he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters , said he had heard much of their beauty , but that , in this instance , fame had fallen short of the truth 	2.2199343018601176
" " i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us 	2.779406766530987
but though he was now established only as a tenant , miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table , nor was mrs hurst , who had married a man of more fashion than fortune , less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her 	2.3755383436839166
you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy 	2.402269908149688
for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton , these visitors came 	2.5384310639717427
in the hall they parted 	3.5796191649203535
and so generous , that you will always exceed your income 	2.9953687254220847
there was no one therefore who could be pointed out , as likely to give any news of him 	2.55391794428864
and it is that which makes the wonder 	2.8204838787337696
these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay 	2.7020361823502266
but unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters 	2.532124363464769
" there is a gentleman with him , mamma , " said kitty 	3.7798484243427066
the feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten 	2.5607256186160385
" " i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time 	2.507520823348389
" mrs gardiner , to whom the chief of this news had been given before , in the course of jane and elizabeth ' s correspondence with her , made her sister a slight answer , and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation 	3.05361916840216
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiner ' s curiosity 	3.157506638442712
you deserve no such attention 	3.117188556028814
mr what ' s his name 	2.859581294650024
mr collins readily assented , and a book was produced 	3.7640072599932615
" " and mary king is safe ! " added elizabeth 	2.328205158176646
and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent 	2.447077688332995
coming frequently before breakfast , and always remaining till after supper 	2.690190392966681
and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body 	2.56563138008174
i hope she will turn out well 	2.7279338655616843
of this she was perfectly unaware 	3.6089213370219877
" if he does not come to me , then , " said she , " i shall give him up for ever 	3.565750028068416
your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable 	2.799051848388166
" this was invitation enough 	2.987843197353763
elizabeth , though expecting no less , thanked him with tears of gratitude 	2.4229453866145425
but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there 	2.729543105918176
" " but you are not entitled to know mine 	3.004211486038086
" about a month , " said elizabeth 	3.0163666232939588
" my love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? " said her aunt 	2.8851951392855923
colonel forster came yesterday , having left brighton the day before , not many hours after the express 	2.400131605310559
it is not quite a week since they left brighton 	2.9469930105205093
there was novelty in the scheme , and as , with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters , home could not be faultless , a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake 	2.71743198208158
he addressed himself directly to miss bennet , with a polite congratulation 	3.628103468107495
if your feelings are still what they were last april , tell me so at once 	2.603096096544981
he shall not be in love with me , if i can prevent it 	4.3028826621920855
and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane , received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth 	2.035648576304117
and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners , which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball 	2.615047982249066
but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcy ' s pleasure in the bingleys' invitation to the officers 	2.7704022874006418
so easily guided that his worth was invaluable 	3.2519791309918045
and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information , he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy 	3.0210726039396785
wickham of course wanted more than he could get 	3.1291124957514027
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage 	2.277992034772884
but these are not jane ' s feelings 	3.689190692396919
mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it 	2.858599306107579
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in me 	2.5697490910203356
and though he belonged to one of the universities , he had merely kept the necessary terms , without forming at it any useful acquaintance 	2.6741984749853858
he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother 	2.6853066245420028
" elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine , and his kind intention of christening , marrying , and burying his parishioners whenever it were required 	2.8969260902046194
and really , all things considered , i begin to think it perfectly reasonable 	2.607256657930876
jane , who was not so light , nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth , soon lagged behind , while her sister , panting for breath , came up with him , and eagerly cried out , " oh , papa , what news ? what news ? have you heard from my uncle ? " " yes , i have had a letter from him by express 	2.9574354223410686
that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful , and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex 	2.5250827723104865
i have not an instant to lose 	3.0288500879037104
" oh ! mr collins ! " " my dear madam , " replied he , " let us be for ever silent on this point 	3.462676960241782
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics , meryton , the neighbourhood , the society , appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen , and speaking of the latter especially , with gentle but very intelligible gallantry 	2.1419156357480533
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise 	2.797039229758908
by reason , by reflection , by every thing 	2.9241465568858347
by the author of " sense and sensibility 	2.006044895438726
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which i cannot wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects 	2.5501572955762
do not imagine , miss bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified 	3.4393526861295074
he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser , by the hundred that was to be paid them 	3.138283898134179
you thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say 	2.392765207978954
" lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these 	2.2830278088669242
allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , miss bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety 	2.5342178812927325
but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine 	2.673273220283291
" " do you really think so ? " cried elizabeth , brightening up for a moment 	3.146408501949456
and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own 	2.581830892841657
that they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable 	2.435624708959392
and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him 	2.4968883480540334
they owed the restoration of lydia , her character , every thing to him 	3.8090517237503234
the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat , drink , and sleep , and pursue the usual course of their employments 	2.0392694191377267
colonel fitzwilliam ' s manners were very much admired at the parsonage , and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings 	2.539013777772631
" the tumult of elizabeth ' s mind was allayed by this conversation 	3.41237329109798
you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself 	2.557101972133516
upon the whole , therefore , she found , what has been sometimes found before , that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire , did not in taking place , bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself 	2.3783800088598746
i will take care of myself , and of mr wickham too 	4.010253806823668
miss darcy was tall , and on a larger scale than elizabeth 	2.9129890580431925
any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn , i suppose , would appear far 	2.5843576531127677
for he is now in the custody of his friend , and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london ! my dear aunt , how could you think of it ? mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street , but he would hardly think a month ' s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it 	2.958038528056535
at length darcy spoke , and in a constrained manner said , " mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them , is less certain 	2.65540008806028
there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds 	3.4647532279343207
" you begin to comprehend me , do you ? " cried he , turning towards her 	2.6957238793856537
colonel fitzwilliam ' s occasionally laughing at his stupidity , proved that he was generally different , which her own knowledge of him could not have told her 	2.4497412922619675
mary would not understand them 	3.189905169223958
mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july , and must be in london again within a month 	2.65412312676449
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment 	3.02075294404282
and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh , i think it will be very tolerable 	3.3672874864712594
and , in short , as the time drew near , she would have been very sorry for any delay 	3.096426132161306
miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy , her sister scarcely less so 	3.246605696909022
and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world 	3.1728156905428317
" her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister , who joined her with a cheerful look , which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors , than elizabeth 	2.337253902417035
a fortnight ' s acquaintance is certainly very little 	2.889659407446436
he seemed astonished too on finding her alone , and apologised for his intrusion , by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within 	2.982704593972232
but , if i were you , i would stand by the nephew 	3.548946836104555
his regard for her was quite imaginary 	3.1442641987183495
mr collins ' s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs bennet 	2.795727348007609
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching 	2.434291653658498
after welcoming their sisters , they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords , exclaiming , " is not this nice ? is not this an agreeable surprise ? " " and we mean to treat you all , " added lydia 	2.4189836194022476
chapter ix 	3.554720655478363
" " of whom does jane ever think ill ? and who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? but jane knows , as well as i do , what wickham really is 	2.1405244091769817
i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time 	2.186120970100154
" chapter vi 	2.967503856688297
on reaching the house , they were shewn through the hall into the saloon , whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer 	2.873240955213039
" vol 	3.545220664477855
for though i am the youngest , i'm the tallest 	3.7647426675756512
we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough 	2.3733767133195505
will you tell me how long you have loved him ? " " it has been coming on so gradually , that i hardly know when it began 	2.878422944296044
and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry 	2.717965170305054
the fee is owed to the owner of the project gutenberg tm trademark , but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation 	2.296661166837389
" " perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often 	2.9278747499266244
" she times them ill 	2.9861385535010956
your feelings , i know , will bestow it unwillingly , but i demand it of your justice 	2.749212139907513
the comfort to her , of the regiment ' s approaching removal , was indeed beyond expression 	3.0154508435471477
and with a more smiling solemnity replied , " it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably 	2.888973618286722
" " did not you ? i did for you 	2.7238909403214744
you do not know what he really is 	3.3797210971940173
every object in the next day ' s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth 	2.571237541695771
in her own past behaviour , there was a constant source of vexation and regret 	2.75619308842474
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt 	2.8228819145967474
and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her 	3.3110468769491193
" " i am talking of possibilities , charles 	3.4064000840962567
the fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention 	2.760184975875702
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley 	2.156313806724011
i want to talk very seriously 	3.129978209049922
chapter iii 	3.5528427098738913
" " she will drop the acquaintance entirely 	2.6316990732197256
" in meryton they parted 	3.2074793729948006
" i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend 	2.368530954499454
for who would object to such a partner ? " elizabeth looked archly , and turned away 	3.4154681171964887
she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater what shall i call it ? susceptibility to her feelings 	2.772018385839933
" " then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , " said mrs bennet 	2.756839668841497
they are wanted in the farm , mr bennet , are not they ? " " they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them 	2.6066153396496246
but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class 	2.344730599282566
it was not all settled before monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to longbourn 	2.560512003394719
their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets 	2.7270108467795833
and , though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt , and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out , she distinguished no part of the scene 	2.670923324627325
miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received , in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense 	2.9649173028572915
" he acknowledged the truth of it all 	3.0475704545319524
contact the foundation as set forth in section <num> below 	2.5253599045918835
" i have found out , " said he , " by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness 	2.93888026086697
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her , but elizabeth always laughed at the idea 	2.753142078252171
he merely answered her question , and read on 	2.803253247753419
mr collins , meanwhile , was meditating in solitude on what had passed 	2.8091633264777363
her husband looked impenetrably grave 	3.135392157493842
chapter vii 	3.795770813013684
the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity 	2.1433364647755053
as soon as they entered the copse , lady catherine began in the following manner : " you can be at no loss , miss bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither 	2.490200723485266
" elizabeth could not oppose such a wish 	2.7702070003463843
but she could not approve him 	3.8585409762456315
but whatever she said , was spoken in so authoritative a tone , as marked her self importance , and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeth ' s mind 	2.445356386341356
they were in fact very fine ladies 	2.9248285972828074
it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world 	2.1936899817216906
to the last 	4.95193917853784
miss bingley ' s letter arrived , and put an end to doubt 	2.945652519654251
four or five thousand a year 	2.869037951516487
and when they parted , after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield , and embracing her most tenderly , she even shook hands with the former 	2.641930171416973
and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon , was such an instance of lady catherine ' s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough 	2.4073614429304913
i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object 	3.0651858559833514
but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him , her anger was turned against herself 	3.223448337860299
" " i am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins , and could say much on the subject , but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate 	3.0507216182356176
he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man 	2.8236903388078454
and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection 	2.342746291327785
what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy ? you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing 	2.725702824253671
however , i did not hear above one word in ten , for i was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear wickham 	3.040823902544451
and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world 	2.857881024318527
and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks 	2.3817283102682594
" " mr _ , you see , is the man ! now , lizzy , i think i have surprised you 	2.710405242896204
elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance 	2.703881356317789
before any answer could arrive from mr collins , or any congratulations to elizabeth , from his wife , the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge 	2.8005042179825166
and the evening , though as it passed it seemed long , was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion 	2.635729633958969
you refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude 	2.7773571544760562
upon the whole , i am much pleased with him 	3.539155286861106
two inferences , however , were plainly deduced from the whole 	4.075959337001668
i wish i could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that i despair 	3.2505549875233215
" oh ! my dear father , " she cried , " come back , and write immediately 	3.0416146304201948
the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit , and the result of it was , that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield 	2.819098018057834
" on his approaching them soon afterwards , though without seeming to have any intention of speaking , miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him , which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it , she turned to him and said , " did not you think , mr darcy , that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton ? " " with great energy 	2.6548609348391934
" " with the officers ! " cried lydia 	3.2333282828805356
they found mr bennet still up 	2.914160079067081
at that moment , she cared for no other 	2.926624487960818
you are not going to be missish , i hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report 	4.029138130453374
her ease and good spirits increased 	3.3578102449260587
but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent 	2.1868028142622378
console lady catherine as well as you can 	3.8537667751206515
and as to miss bennet , he could not conceive an angel more beautiful 	3.1488548017470945
" " oh ! where , where is my uncle ? " cried elizabeth , darting from her seat as she finished the letter , in eagerness to follow him , without losing a moment of the time so precious 	2.6123482097510404
the first part of mrs gardiner ' s business on her arrival , was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions 	2.667436699442803
she was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady lucas has been very kind 	2.961964180148968
when the engagement was for home , some of the officers always made part of it , of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one 	2.7864579499923696
" " now i have got some news for you , " said lydia , as they sat down to table 	2.862262025391476
i am going to gretna green , and if you cannot guess with who , i shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world i love , and he is an angel 	3.1196011954546887
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again , having still a great deal to say to her , and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends 	2.6745972649607297
i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her 	2.3714166104662904
" we can all plague and punish one another 	2.496947712429275
till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction , she had rather be without a confidante 	2.484036118473084
i came to try you 	3.1452340120443147
" that is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon i hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance 	2.6197131489935526
" it is a long time , mr bingley , since you went away , " said mrs bennet 	3.4435600348990913
but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both 	2.0366388017288135
the others have been gone on to scarborough , these three weeks 	3.0136129736673527
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable 	2.8649527168033067
" * * * * * they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday 	2.3735329878791243
lady catherine then observed , " your father ' s estate is entailed on mr collins , i think 	3.239460240772951
" their journey was performed without much conversation , or any alarm 	2.9706742751806052
his air was grave and stately , and his manners were very formal 	3.891671429125749
for , of course , they were to have a son 	4.0220473961121685
miss bennet , i insist on being satisfied 	3.4877123774251473
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here 	2.316363130487343
she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer 	2.4353547892000016
but she was satisfied with none 	3.412586444604795
for the truth of every thing here related , i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father ' s will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions 	2.8609633190377717
" but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only 	2.564745783885631
and had some new extracts to admire , and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to 	3.3788518690187517
but from every window there were beauties to be seen 	2.6018457991108446
not these two or three years perhaps 	3.1478610788820656
and , perhaps , if i have very good luck , i may meet with another mr collins in time 	2.7261103830196918
mr darcy may hug himself 	3.5194098858765344
i have written to colonel forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which i have pledged myself 	3.0422936364596973
" elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning 	2.8640724850461754
but think no more of the letter 	3.612091796697239
it had not been very great 	4.015741421859225
" but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands 	2.892771476075785
and as they entered the house , he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men 	2.604327737713409
" you are a good girl 	3.592934367129356
" he then told her of georgiana ' s delight in her acquaintance , and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption 	2.6350998633571665
caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one 	2.5607338030481044
the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy 	2.8205965632395977
and elizabeth , as they waited for the housekeeper , had leisure to wonder at her being where she was 	2.8313524934092684
as no objection was made to the young people ' s engagement with their aunt , and all mr collins ' s scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted , the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton 	2.5274199475943
" i have sent for you on an affair of importance 	2.489226596935544
on entering the room , he seemed to hesitate 	3.6729146972135767
i ask only a comfortable home 	2.9625010692541034
they were rather handsome , had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town , had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds , were in the habit of spending more than they ought , and of associating with people of rank 	2.649802774279406
after making every possible enquiry on that side london , colonel f 	2.29125508576115
yet there had been that in his voice , which was not like ease 	2.960555738734098
he begged pardon for having displeased her 	2.696494050809056
why jane you never dropt a word of this 	2.756755962537554
" " it is evident by this , " added jane , " that he comes back no more this winter 	2.9608412108611883
but , however , i hope it is not true 	4.383913392078769
" mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile , but elizabeth could not return it 	3.0125000894180043
she knew not how to support herself , and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour 	2.4394361230867267
never , since reading jane ' s second letter , had she entertained a hope of wickham ' s meaning to marry her 	2.7455928352232624
and , after standing a few moments without saying a word , he suddenly recollected himself , and took leave 	2.6101718583703732
" elizabeth ' s astonishment was beyond expression 	3.1102216008801693
the distance is nothing , when one has a motive 	2.550326668514387
and i understand from mrs gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the south 	3.16399946793631
" " this is quite shocking ! he deserves to be publicly disgraced 	2.3358977394892197
after playing some italian songs , miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air 	2.779619793126225
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him 	2.227019560455432
i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but i will not leave the country without confiding them , and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable 	3.051486717334154
and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail ? we cannot suppose he would help it , if he could 	2.4355493569121114
" " i thank you for my share of the favour , " said elizabeth 	2.7549725033322927
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable 	3.2735356160067566
besides , there was truth in his looks 	3.329374217758248
in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and i dare say it would succeed , if miss de bourgh were out of the way 	3.1408447909408594
" " oh , jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! " " perhaps it would have been better 	2.7290800801767396
though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family , or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them 	3.201365313390445
but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right 	2.8483414365248407
in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended 	2.6351615360303065
mr hurst looked at her with astonishment 	3.373000055958874
we had better not mention it 	3.023399884798094
" but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there 	2.5315171054611714
she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother ' s being an inmate of mr darcy ' s house , and mentioned with raptures , some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture 	3.0570374119839414
her father , contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters 	2.934817331809444
and when it closed , elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte ' s degree of contentment , to understand her address in guiding , and composure in bearing with her husband , and to acknowledge that it was all done very well 	3.092870720490328
her ladyship , with great condescension , arose to receive them 	2.9685511505569053
on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband 	3.0362902967343564
" shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? " " i can answer your question , " said fitzwilliam , " without applying to him 	2.6353879400674147
" " perhaps , " said darcy , " i should have judged better , had i sought an introduction , but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers 	2.9098539359241413
" " did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? " " i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady 	2.3372258443045775
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking 	2.467541811745361
<num> of la belle assemblee <num>^{st} july <num>_ ] pride & prejudice 	2.4396640992096437
and miss darcy is always down for the summer months 	2.714333084630033
" jane shook her head 	3.0219491496128446
that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head 	3.0781936513307535
i must find mr gardiner this moment , on business that cannot be delayed 	2.399195812623726
she danced next with an officer , and had the refreshment of talking of wickham , and of hearing that he was universally liked 	3.1453229791864517
" " a little sea bathing would set me up for ever 	2.7037307738312575
and , to imitate his politeness , she began , as they met , to admire the beauty of the place 	3.219312545607992
information about the project gutenberg literary archive foundation the project gutenberg literary archive foundation is a non profit <num>( c )( <num> ) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the internal revenue service 	3.138208387549425
" what will be his surprise , " thought she , " when he knows who they are ! he takes them now for people of fashion 	2.16901218922869
in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived 	2.765605638055904
when the party broke up , lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton , from whence they were to set out early the next morning 	2.457796327227298
a report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago 	2.504438255022496
miss bingley ' s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly , as well as her affection for jane 	3.249451294576386
" " how can you talk so ? " said jane faintly smiling , " you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , i could not hesitate 	2.886121918175793
" " i wish i might take this for a compliment 	2.6988206515402204
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth , where confidence would give pleasure 	2.7288499318536497
colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object 	3.2615500550053182
" from what we have seen of him , " continued mrs gardiner , " i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor wickham 	2.7572728722789916
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? " " oh , yes ! you will only think i feel more than i ought to do , when i tell you all 	2.9485558719665548
he smiled , looked handsome , and said many pretty things 	3.0004670504355593
it was acknowledged , however , that he was a liberal man , and did much good among the poor 	3.1921425564707775
" " that is to say , you had given your permission 	2.999442271166679
he was struggling for the appearance of composure , and would not open his lips , till he believed himself to have attained it 	2.9361636482986926
she will make him a very proper wife 	2.9705902970374995
" " you must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course 	2.463591937890872
" she highly approved his forbearance , and they had leisure for a full discussion of it , and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other , as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn , and during the walk , he particularly attended to her 	2.3586760681186347
he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world 	2.2869315710356006
as to his real character , had information been in her power , she had never felt a wish of enquiring 	3.255268474357088
day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter 	2.1496886141692917
not like the wild young men now a days , who think of nothing but themselves 	2.4367229146502294
elizabeth , though she did not credit above half of what was said , believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister ' s ruin still more certain 	2.7188497000873837
" " but if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required 	2.215018831901056
" vol 	3.545220664477855
the satisfaction of miss bennet ' s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face , as made her look handsomer than ever 	2.6822425966151813
i shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy 	2.6810467761469257
he did look at it and into it for half an hour , was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms , satisfied with what the owner said in its praise , and took it immediately 	2.1731039443446605
" the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy 	2.555821434774177
women fancy admiration means more than it does 	2.6981595077937346
" " that is as it happens 	2.8724194061013337
but shortly recovering himself , advanced towards the party , and spoke to elizabeth , if not in terms of perfect composure , at least of perfect civility 	2.5392207286968564
and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling , was more openly acknowledged , for she did not scruple to call out , " what is that you are saying , fitzwilliam ? what is it you are talking of ? what are you telling miss bennet ? let me hear what it is 	2.3936593117339693
and so , you like this man ' s sisters too , do you ? their manners are not equal to his 	2.3980469524681487
an hour , however , saw the whole completed 	4.2782325550250375
" " nay , if you are so serious about it , i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled 	3.1823118536794825
but she did weep from vexation and envy 	2.984214359125293
she seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her 	3.4516890577550394
though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character 	2.542323942850293
when darcy returned to the saloon , miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister 	3.3711795446170996
was fonder than ever of georgiana , almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore , and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth 	2.799288646203898
i must be in town next saturday 	3.392687513460034
without supposing them , from what she saw , to be very seriously in love , their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy 	2.8685654072713653
" " i might as well enquire , " replied she , " why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? was not this some excuse for incivility , if i was uncivil ? but i have other provocations 	2.329802892590887
could he , or the lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ? mr darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at you in his life ! it is admirable ! " elizabeth tried to join in her father ' s pleasantry , but could only force one most reluctant smile 	2.5995168767632224
her report was highly favourable 	3.124019965617293
chapter iii 	3.5528427098738913
" " i should be sorry indeed , if it were 	3.197793830136217
how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? " " if we are ever able to learn what wickham ' s debts have been , " said elizabeth , " and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them , because wickham has not sixpence of his own 	2.6240155422017444
" " perfectly so i thank you 	2.7494481121151795
but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on , in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice 	1.989635463913067
your profusion makes me saving 	3.1330630128849046
" " this account then is what he has received from mr darcy 	2.696541666256432
with a glance she saw , that he had lost none of his recent civility 	3.0645022974959715
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth 	3.0899394712142745
you could not make me happy , and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so 	3.4899466184076666
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your ' s 	2.7531429753830596
" " i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself 	3.010668147210857
but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face , than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes 	2.5683162051585344
* * * * * mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother 	2.419122506637047
i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy 	2.3539505961450793
i cannot do justice to his kindness 	2.891971028968714
found fault with the arrangement of the furniture , or detected the housemaid in negligence 	3.354777303661425
it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both 	3.0168139766156723
" this letter gave elizabeth some pain 	2.628195888142676
chapter xi 	3.554720655478363
which , as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence , she accordingly read 	2.5304226778104746
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother , on her ladyship ' s entrance , though no request of introduction had been made 	2.711265424772885
on the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself 	3.0965433404572322
she cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving wickham 	2.764280560556269
but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs philips , and was , by her watchfulness , most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin 	3.0047558013976543
though lydia had never been a favourite with them , mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeply affected 	3.0883133207093465
email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the foundation ' s web site and official page at <url> for additional contact information : dr 	1.9285897775312901
her ladyship was highly incensed 	3.5285235369959116
elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all , but she could see it and write of it without material pain 	2.9525709877587363
" " and do you like her ? " " very much 	3.126061524714938
and the possibility of her deserving her mother ' s reproach prevented his feeling any regret 	3.0193098954444775
the strangeness of mr collins ' s making two offers of marriage within three days , was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted 	2.691149689729124
perhaps she is full young to be much in company 	2.6912846917566506
on saturday he came again 	3.244581131824322
a respectable looking , elderly woman , much less fine , and more civil , than she had any notion of finding her 	2.4411105361071606
they both set off , and the conjectures of the remaining three continued , though with little satisfaction , till the door was thrown open , and their visitor entered 	2.6141148598670125
her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts 	2.738763907228628
" " you are mistaken 	3.092345822166498
but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence 	2.0212296479020133
what could your ladyship propose by it ? " " at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted 	2.8065057144265952
they will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to longbourn 	2.2972171193875965
you have widely mistaken my character , if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these 	2.7525243950644778
she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them 	2.3567114193625907
miss bennet had slept ill , and though up , was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room 	2.8190339413615138
they gradually ascended for half a mile , and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence , where the wood ceased , and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house , situated on the opposite side of a valley , into which the road with some abruptness wound 	2.5987251108535627
causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , i had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me 	2.635788968650906
but now as the first shock is over , shall i own that i long for your return ? i am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient 	2.977647309095693
but when she read , and re read with the closest attention , the particulars immediately following of wickham ' s resigning all pretensions to the living , of his receiving in lieu , so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds , again was she forced to hesitate 	2.286535179462208
when the clock struck three , elizabeth felt that she must go 	2.8893228275051923
the good news quickly spread through the house 	2.6578304667751205
but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person , countenance , air , and walk , as they were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle philips , breathing port wine , who followed them into the room 	3.0971690336458013
" " and yours , " he replied with a smile , " is wilfully to misunderstand them 	2.9781720454887344
but charlotte , she soon found , was depending on the plan , and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty 	2.9959534541484247
can you , yourself , lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? " " not perhaps of neglecting his own interest 	3.1511732645048918
and quitting them both , he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton , denominated from that period lucas lodge , where he could think with pleasure of his own importance , and unshackled by business , occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world 	2.5797443152734627
i should say , one of her ladyship ' s carriages , for she has several 	3.202641593001075
he resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds 	2.458993521012433
when she remembered the style of his address , she was still full of indignation 	2.6811115365443823
but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know 	2.7577330321446683
and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was , though mrs bennet ' s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away 	2.471664458312797
" it keeps him in good humour , " said she , " and i am more obliged to you than i can express 	3.0377939004219496
" his estate there is a noble one 	3.086257927528856
the children , two girls of six and eight years old , and two younger boys , were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane , who was the general favourite , and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them , playing with them , and loving them 	2.2354568218744775
i hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , i am absolutely certain 	3.0471677468036806
" " oh ! but the gentlemen will have mr bingley ' s chaise to go to meryton 	2.7574398963001086
" i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude 	2.7657255131762524
it will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance 	2.2507295409539383
but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself , while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly , and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas , that he was a remarkably clever , good kind of young man 	2.389315231070096
darcy said nothing at all 	3.133719869559862
they were in street 	3.6335920702204088
" safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune 	2.699848417779974
" " but you how are you ? " cried elizabeth 	2.758936716156696
the pain of separation , however , might be alleviated on his side , by preparations for the reception of his bride , as he had reason to hope , that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire , the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men 	2.646691720180165
" i am thinking of what you have been telling me , " said she 	3.3327427781522516
but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful 	3.1677844857710826
i was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that you , that miss elizabeth bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , mr darcy 	2.391951037379079
" the introduction , however , was immediately made 	3.385565881588898
for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce 	2.7152298272448347
but mrs bennet , was not so well pleased with it 	3.7752289314705925
elizabeth instantly read her feelings , and at that moment solicitude for wickham , resentment against his enemies , and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane ' s being in the fairest way for happiness 	3.253905189601488
and whatever he did , done gracefully 	3.0837449237611008
mr darcy walked off 	3.432156053930086
jane recollected herself soon , and putting the letter away , tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation 	2.207164462718173
" haye park might do , " said she , " if the gouldings would quit it , or the great house at stoke , if the drawing room were larger 	2.986537622627956
they will have nothing else to do 	3.2474372075419944
they were then , with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance , taken into the house 	2.678955716947064
at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him , but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application , and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal , if he had not been well assured of his cousin ' s corroboration 	3.2777257275958744
wherever you and jane are known , you must be respected and valued 	2.8914561748759784
lord ! how i laughed ! and so did mrs forster 	2.7635758996034214
but it will have no effect on me 	2.9809202970646225
in another minute mr bingley , but without seeming to have noticed what passed , took leave and rode on with his friend 	2.6508609746453837
" their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them 	2.44631540347987
she practises very constantly 	3.4803923583943717
she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood , nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two , to visit his relations 	2.238960827209205
her affections had been continually fluctuating , but never without an object 	2.8414088221356764
the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities , though at first unwillingly admitted , had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings 	2.529566362973983
" " and what am i to do on the occasion ? it seems an hopeless business 	2.374320898012052
on tuesday , his wife received a letter from him 	3.094614086993018
she wished to discredit it entirely , repeatedly exclaiming , " this must be false ! this cannot be ! this must be the grossest falsehood ! " and when she had gone through the whole letter , though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two , put it hastily away , protesting that she would not regard it , that she would never look in it again 	2.532082537246534
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family 	2.5678064106735996
elizabeth again , and more seriously assured her of its truth 	3.4179915203206503
it would have been strange if they had 	3.2207574496651916
charlotte had seen them from her husband ' s room , crossing the road , and immediately running into the other , told the girls what an honour they might expect , adding , " i may thank you , eliza , for this piece of civility 	2.632162132939665
james ' s 	3.380143181312107
he was on one side of her mother 	3.4062857197156173
all were struck with the stranger ' s air , all wondered who he could be , and kitty and lydia , determined if possible to find out , led the way across the street , under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop , and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot 	2.1689863941914354
kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in lydia ' s last letter , she had prepared her for such a step 	3.1765918388229895
the gardiners staid a week at longbourn 	2.93026572804541
and as for purvis lodge , the attics are dreadful 	3.1015578155418875
if you mention my name at the bell , you will be attended to 	2.7736291059181837
but his cousin , after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs collins , sat for some time without speaking to any body 	2.353047447768859
" i am sure , " said she , " i cried for two days together when colonel millar ' s regiment went away 	2.6609722866966883
it was , moreover , such a promising thing for her younger daughters , as jane ' s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men 	2.4461126093963355
the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited 	3.423862498451294
and while she steadily repressed it , could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing , that however long , and for whatever cause , his attentions had been withdrawn , her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal 	2.4110708685578004
this letter is from mr collins 	3.427044456287823
one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions 	2.623819531450128
march was to take elizabeth to hunsford 	2.9729906642745205
elizabeth jumped out 	4.389816151212726
i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters , and beg leave to apologise for it , as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends , but of this hereafter 	2.3968926020725414
it was an encouragement of vice 	2.7614330829814477
" " so much the better 	2.833187103805456
it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours , which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable 	3.0979126319993493
there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer 	2.8764661559472398
you are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on 	2.3983989341504417
may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? " " they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible 	2.410352847142695
he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter 	3.6568980628874863
mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood 	2.670094995160784
she will be taken good care of 	3.0882922313713665
consider how important every moment is , in such a case 	2.874507696690872
gardiner 	5.044829902789781
and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her , was still more strange 	2.744455386359731
after wandering along the lane for two hours , giving way to every variety of thought 	2.2308319450063663
till , shaking off his embarrassment , he turned to her again , and said in the gentlest of accents , " you , who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right 	2.79926740285596
i think not 	3.9140301913592186
mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure , and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview , with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied , since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character 	2.2797569566761924
in a short time , i shall have a daughter married 	3.688370458792987
she has known him only a fortnight 	2.8404361941429586
you agree that you have no remedies for negligence , strict liability , breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph <num>	3.358252381951613
" " if you mean darcy , " cried her brother , " he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing 	2.905432048362389
he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while 	2.505851709156176
you must and shall be married by a special licence 	2.4845551896209535
risk any thing rather than her displeasure 	2.859017401169976
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter , as soon as she possibly could 	2.5565035512248047
" jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail 	2.637587370843998
" " well , " cried her mother , " it is all very right 	3.466571884676087
for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them 	2.851072300155351
but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to 	2.5038570843458863
you know not what you are about 	3.4439872763878383
she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate , though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it 	2.15480939604612
but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill 	2.826436399187045
he knows of my being in town , i am certain , from something she said herself 	3.032566465472709
your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins , and i will never see you again if you do 	2.875436817406773
" they are married ! " elizabeth read on 	3.1601074540896716
their eyes instantly met , and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush 	3.396824512668047
<num>	4.24676143746824
regard for my sister ' s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but i wrote to mr wickham , who left the place immediately , and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge 	2.8723223945361207
my situation in life , my connections with the family of de bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour 	2.3195898246008158
and i assure you , i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement 	2.88550799425899
and could she have included jane in the scheme , every part of it would have been perfect 	2.8503721558762414
mr bingley , his two sisters , the husband of the eldest , and another young man 	2.5557437261343994
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence , she could not imagine 	3.018836928198692
but , whenever she did catch a glimpse , she saw an expression of general complaisance , and in all that he said , she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions , as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed , however temporary its existence might prove , had at least outlived one day 	2.3987958380904457
" " i cannot pretend to be sorry , " said wickham , after a short interruption , " that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts 	3.018917305291393
she dared not even mention that gentleman 	2.971619605513062
and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning , if miss bennet were not decidedly better 	2.343397962815185
" " if we thought alike of miss bingley , " replied jane , " your representation of all this , might make me quite easy 	2.823141571520664
his brow contracted , his air gloomy 	4.306114657740159
but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line 	3.0878917857456525
the faces of both , however , were tolerably calm 	3.51499818041532

you must send john with the young ladies , mrs collins 	3.312647729868124
while thus engaged , elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy , by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room 	2.6196629669021627
within doors there was lady catherine , books , and a billiard table , but gentlemen cannot be always within doors 	2.745244813062543
" " write to me very often , my dear 	3.209797936743991
and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour , that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford , she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam ' s and mr darcy ' s having both spent three weeks at rosings , and asked him if he were acquainted with the former 	2.3926348261332206
you know he is , as well as i do 	3.35020307675243
is not it so , mrs bennet ? " " yes , or i will never see her again 	3.312680983807321
since her father ' s death , her home has been london , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education 	3.064337959054204
and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas , whom she had not seen for a week , she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin , and to point him out to her particular notice 	3.3258620333988453
" " that will make your ladyship ' s situation at present more pitiable 	2.7608970596109113
i shall now know how to act 	3.262465140238793
" " it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should 	2.7105852765873086
" who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? " " his misfortunes ! " repeated darcy contemptuously 	2.4175098898196192
and therefore gave them to understand , in as guarded a manner as she could , that by what she had heard from his relations in kent , his actions were capable of a very different construction 	2.4818168676484413
so , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next 	2.7008708232232843
she is almost three and twenty ! lord , how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty ! my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands , you can't think 	2.1456140633866783
" in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennet ' s visit , and sat about ten minutes with him in his library 	2.758105917183925
i know it cannot be long 	3.8834133577454995
since the shire were first quartered in meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head 	3.193917015799153
from the farther disadvantage of lydia ' s society she was of course carefully kept , and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her , with the promise of balls and young men , her father would never consent to her going 	2.488488280148683
he looked surprised , displeased , alarmed 	2.7302284421167604
elizabeth was disgusted , and even miss bennet was shocked 	3.1389793202065577
she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy , though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded 	2.6586276296302676
tell her that you insist upon her marrying him 	2.536820380383407
" he is just what a young man ought to be , " said she , " sensible , good humoured , lively 	2.9074405089395374
you refuse , then , to oblige me 	3.250908692579421
" " that is a failing indeed ! " cried elizabeth 	3.0075797481958153
the recollection of what i then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me 	2.6664097637628443
gone to stay 	4.2395645732777005
mrs bennet all amazement , though flattered by having a guest of such high importance , received her with the utmost politeness 	2.119773392645966
she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion , five and twenty years ago 	2.4738852858059324
her father captivated by youth and beauty , and that appearance of good humour , which youth and beauty generally give , had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind , had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her 	2.2198090021118517
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected 	2.5372449853504575
" you were mr bingley ' s first choice 	3.489090053826221
you wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if i speak ill of any body 	2.561767220194001
she stared , coloured , doubted , and was silent 	2.7938188638557113
it was dated from rosings , at eight o'clock in the morning , and was as follows : " be not alarmed , madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you 	2.6036645659902664
my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken 	2.794406031610969
a few days after this visit , mr bingley called again , and alone 	3.355692551865308
though her spirits are greatly shaken 	2.9137412411347445
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham , when she read with somewhat clearer attention , a relation of events , which , if true , must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth , and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself , her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition 	2.279948434296528
" he only told me , what i have now told you 	3.107936973861016
but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane , to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs gardiner ' s letter , or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him 	2.7597550426542643
i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn 	2.5664054549203437
" his daughter ' s request , for such it might be considered , of being admitted into her family again , before she set off for the north , received at first an absolute negative 	2.2882737160210707
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane , on their first arrival at lambton 	2.721120839565234
iii 	5.727374821554181
chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for my sake 	3.0654368917104438
" " what sort of a girl is miss darcy ? " he shook his head 	2.8176285573750794
and as to my father , i never in my life saw him so affected 	3.040293340248239
he sustained it however with fortitude , and so far from going away , turned back with them , and entered into conversation with mr gardiner 	3.207314952612236
" on such encouragement to ask , elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power , by running away 	2.5390769465186187
she was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse 	2.8138037175153636
but that is what a governess will prevent , and if i had known your mother , i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one 	2.8330692942286073
they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn , the village where they lived , and of which they were the principal inhabitants 	2.53645925647446
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning , but the post came in without bringing a single line from him 	2.521942024072224
he cannot know what mr darcy is 	3.9494092421208165
we must forget it ourselves 	2.998014964493343
she had no fear of its spreading farther , through his means 	3.1439562880940284
it is very unlucky 	3.8348910043526887
it is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world 	2.8327541856972585
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure 	2.776179543020146
she tried , however , to compose herself to answer him with patience , when he should have done 	2.8688293299065943
in the former were many good paintings 	2.8815643573979
her niece was , therefore , obliged to submit , and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river , in the nearest direction 	2.797761771127366
and , while examining the nearer aspect of the house , all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned 	2.5575957822845092
and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice 	2.3397663690721293
and very lively hopes of mr bingley ' s heart were entertained 	3.0112702791189183
" he then went away , and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself 	2.7933315103772545
" " no , " replied jane , " i have not forgotten him 	3.7412073179346557
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine 	2.583013303777291
he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place , and his intrigues , all honoured with the title of seduction , had been extended into every tradesman ' s family 	3.911059951338131
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here 	3.069683555549039
i am sure you must feel it so 	3.1837742451312576
she had only to say in reply , that they had wandered about , till she was beyond her own knowledge 	3.1158461633270096
i have more than once observed to lady catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her 	3.0817265525428046
her voice was weak , and her manner affected 	3.258405445067159
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her , the very day after her reaching pemberley 	2.6781407953954735
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry miss darcy 	2.787608632350795
elizabeth , equally next to jane in birth and beauty , succeeded her of course 	2.2643121617303112
" elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it , and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards 	2.5707971991887586
" mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments 	3.623792505026402
[ illustration : dove dale ] pride & prejudice 	2.4602421187493118
but you do not know all 	4.372692544029899
when it was no longer likely they should meet 	3.3744764199745836
but i ought to beg his pardon , for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant 	3.131251864193893
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer , as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces 	2.92754864024848
every sister except mary agreed to go with her 	2.5932865500500726
and in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away 	2.5311009370746573
wickham will never marry a woman without some money 	2.62005249963793
" mr darcy smiled 	3.557650269303857
" " perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her 	2.7866893122431744
could there be finer symptoms ? is not general incivility the very essence of love ? " " oh , yes ! of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt 	2.5166871521027585
at first there seemed danger of lydia ' s engrossing him entirely , for she was a most determined talker 	3.2246228974947497
he observed to her , at a moment when the others were talking together , and in a tone which had something of real regret , that it " was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her 	2.8314287697026614
we may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon 	2.4887372246864645
and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins , was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate , and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house , as soon as mr bennet were dead 	2.7064731234689994
till i was in kent , and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation , colonel fitzwilliam , i was ignorant of the truth myself 	3.055694338519093
" " this is the only point , i flatter myself , on which we do not agree 	2.9362888542686933
in spite of her deeply rooted dislike , she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man ' s affection , and though her intentions did not vary for an instant , she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive 	3.171385500362176
we do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance 	2.58061047685075
and fearful , on the contrary , as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long , she urged jane to borrow mr bingley ' s carriage immediately , and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned , and the request made 	2.435987842078798
i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner 	2.398937493810534
if you wish to charge a fee or distribute a project gutenberg tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement , you must obtain permission in writing from both the project gutenberg literary archive foundation and michael hart , the owner of the project gutenberg tm trademark 	2.2527035221383613
by elizabeth ' s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband , which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself 	2.415529366366173
that he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating 	4.641050664027254
come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia ' s folly 	3.2158199780501047
" elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word 	2.8998989451773958
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that i had known it , and purposely kept it from him 	2.671504086271614
and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters , by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william , in which she was readily joined by jane , and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match , the excellent character of mr collins , and the convenient distance of hunsford from london 	2.629866519480744
but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future 	2.577896885612233
" he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word 	3.3645150611999926
she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of 	2.6135372514707718
no one but mrs bennet , regretted that their stay would be so short 	2.990500847420536
and they soon became sensible , that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old , and whose own manners indicated respectability , was not to be hastily rejected 	2.3657521031322895
and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself , and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power , which her fancy told her she still possessed , of bringing on the renewal of his addresses 	2.5174068665166756
it is a pity they are not handsome ! not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend 	2.383122039957301
it will save me a world of trouble and economy 	2.3918612945757682
" " i would not be so fastidious as you are , " cried bingley , " for a kingdom ! upon my honour , i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as i have this evening 	3.0645813497975416
and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away 	3.42113742632548
not one party , or scheme , or any thing 	2.8437326554333566
but as soon as he was gone , he turned to his daughter and said , " jane , i congratulate you 	3.0875510946050038
but our visitor was very obstinate 	2.8920235430184005
mrs gardiner , who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth , gave her a look expressive of her wonder 	2.840585281309514
from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach , and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collins ' s side , and as many bows on sir william ' s , they departed 	2.9635050806934897
indeed he has no improper pride 	3.4533388777668925
the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming 	2.1647289351406944
" then , " observed elizabeth , " you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman 	3.1456936598182113
and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment 	2.3604579178833367
" " but you forget , mama , " said elizabeth , " that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that mrs long has promised to introduce him 	3.293106289048637
for your sake , " turning to charlotte , " i am glad of it 	3.073483280013402
but to her own more extensive information , he was the person , to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits , and whom she regarded herself with an interest , if not quite so tender , at least as reasonable and just , as what jane felt for bingley 	2.59694839425904
chapter xi 	3.554720655478363
every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections 	2.8641930273714724
this matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled 	3.030970401216696
he was the proudest , most disagreeable man in the world , and every body hoped that he would never come there again 	3.409396458112766
" " our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money 	2.3900627327650454
my father and mother believe the worst , but i cannot think so ill of him 	3.0701072616991234
to own the truth , with wickham ! imagine our surprise 	2.5083389586348277
he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention 	2.4998302081849353
'lady catherine ,' said she , 'you have given me a treasure 	3.096710820612036
this has been my motive , my fair cousin , and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem 	3.110106047711684
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart 	2.0988870715865633
in the gallery there were many family portraits , but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger 	2.8916145962815194
i thought too ill of him , to invite him to pemberley , or admit his society in town 	2.6711966709895045
this was agreed to , and mrs philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets , and a little bit of hot supper afterwards 	2.394764742265768
" a gentleman and a stranger ! it is mr bingley i am sure 	3.042963180277494
i shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance i require 	2.6915914305150186
my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this 	2.385315807556735
jane now came up 	3.4481371667208993
and what is to divide them ? the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune 	2.763567622183235
yes , she will do for him very well 	3.3338689303736992
" " i am not going to run away , papa , " said kitty , fretfully 	3.049607856120347
they are gone off together from brighton 	2.7072445371328957
but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas 	2.3805363208462342
" how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ! her aunt now called her to look at a picture 	1.964485315573898
" i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places 	2.3799525035998434
" i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter ! " " la ! my dear , " said maria quite shocked at the mistake , " it is not lady catherine 	2.71850757261168
and , before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt , of which her daughter sat in momentary dread , bingley , who wanted to be alone with jane , proposed their all walking out 	2.3701175987668237
miss darcy ' s praise occupied the chief of it 	3.5355152235011946
why does she not come in ? " " oh ! charlotte says , she hardly ever does 	2.728831349126889
" " i am sorry you think so 	2.9722907757040034
to elizabeth it appeared , that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening , it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit , or finer success 	2.46815615232832
if you have not been mistaken here , i must have been in an error 	3.5909087545749045
or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour 	2.3433610724808256
all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes 	2.6969342263279534
if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him 	3.6530134591078123
when her mother went up to her dressing room at night , she followed her , and made the important communication 	2.8759561841908283
and they conversed with so much spirit and flow , as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself , as well as of mr darcy 	2.9416337396654897
my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did 	2.3441899504673733
mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast 	3.059932121280227
it is such a spur to one ' s genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind 	3.369495184306307
and in her air altogether , there is a self sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable 	2.7645719837180898
his surprise was great 	3.5160800315176535
when this information was given , and they had all taken their seats , mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire , and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment , that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings 	2.5608205495318406
they were to be off as soon as possible 	3.8814690102161986
but , on second thoughts , perhaps lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person 	2.092601286145985
and between her and mrs gardiner , with occasional help from elizabeth , the conversation was carried on 	2.6855662699710576
and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries , which jane was equally eager to satisfy 	2.2532467265743
i do comprehend a great deal in it 	3.069423839185641
" for we must attribute this happy conclusion , " she added , " in a great measure , to his kindness 	2.6328890270893393
our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to you shall try it some day 	2.1354926626040323
i hoped to find you reasonable 	3.0774853945800285
he meant to resign his commission immediately 	3.5393923988817226
in short , my dear aunt , i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy 	3.5907810047479995
and at that moment she felt , that to be mistress of pemberley might be something ! they descended the hill , crossed the bridge , and drove to the door 	2.1390325128324403
" " if you believed it impossible to be true , " said elizabeth , colouring with astonishment and disdain , " i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far 	2.8011805678120103
every thing , however , went on smoothly , and was finally settled according to charlotte ' s first sketch 	3.791932823220732
" " it is no such thing 	2.7964218396839144
and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints , they parted 	2.583229145803328
and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning 	3.0175666985246066
she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors , she wanted to compose her own , and to make herself agreeable to all 	3.1142996369915372
mr collins was punctual to his time , and was received with great politeness by the whole family 	3.73531625225784
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth 	2.708249365131482
and unwilling for her sister ' s sake , to provoke him , she only said in reply , with a good humoured smile , " come , mr wickham , we are brother and sister , you know 	3.0853496469177
she approached , and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended , amongst several other miniatures , over the mantle piece 	2.814813835767819
" it may perhaps be pleasant , " replied charlotte , " to be able to impose on the public in such a case 	3.416012736907482
but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty 	2.415035246632998
he left netherfield for london , on the day following , as you , i am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning 	3.1096332940080424
" " colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on lydia ' s side , but nothing to give him any alarm 	2.4247490289987788
my father was not only fond of this young man ' s society , whose manners were always engaging 	2.524776987438235
" and her residence there will probably be of some duration 	2.665374317218612
" " i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women 	2.3216222793757955
" " and your defect is a propensity to hate every body 	3.0036789300181277
and she was , in fact , almost engrossed by her nephews , speaking to them , especially to darcy , much more than to any other person in the room 	2.9697688659027794
my head is always full of something else 	2.7958961287980935
they were natural and just 	3.1780823960707165
their fortune on both sides is splendid 	2.8850931321986826
" " what is his name ? " " bingley 	3.5616278188224397
my avowed one , or what i avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which i have since made 	2.6986891300731424
the whole of what elizabeth had already heard , his claims on mr darcy , and all that he had suffered from him , was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed 	3.181629090870206
i shall certainly try to get the better 	2.965020376862121
but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you 	2.711825556789206
send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly 	2.7220954620194115
nay , which has already arisen from it , i am sure you would judge differently in the affair 	2.759388405558071
the eldest of them , a sensible , intelligent young woman , about twenty seven , was elizabeth ' s intimate friend 	2.999843450336345
they were within twenty yards of each other , and so abrupt was his appearance , that it was impossible to avoid his sight 	2.9623584717403784
i do not wish to avoid the walk 	3.4698870814196234
and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling 	2.5281665268622144
" " oh ! your father of course may spare you , if your mother can 	2.16618927112919
he knows where we live 	3.0969286956030677
she was even sensible of some pleasure , though mixed with regret , on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself 	2.160753966336649
she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved 	3.176060737964531
and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern , when kitty left them , she went boldly on with him alone 	2.3605716317831913
in a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost 	2.6044979918516336
the subject was pursued no farther , and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away 	3.396189170589086
gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham , who followed his lady , and wished them both joy , with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness 	2.328122886303803
professor michael s 	4.011234620168879
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship 	2.469411977389062
" she paused , and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse 	2.9327805070513424
from the entrance hall , of which mr collins pointed out , with a rapturous air , the fine proportion and finished ornaments , they followed the servants through an anti chamber , to the room where lady catherine , her daughter , and mrs jenkinson were sitting 	2.8431434434767024
but let me advise you to think better of it 	2.749893042884059
the younger ones out before the elder are married ! your younger sisters must be very young ? " " yes , my youngest is not sixteen 	2.528307625909752
it now first struck her , that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage , and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings , in the absence of more eligible visitors 	2.623611126065312
your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications 	2.4242978134212145
and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again 	2.1743900605189936
do not let us quarrel about the past 	2.915085329301551
no , never 	4.164557128133946
mary had neither genius nor taste 	2.9981595717272005
that they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! oh , lydia ! " " i comfort myself with thinking , " replied jane , " that he certainly would not marry lydia , if he had not a real regard for her 	2.7048844603273396
she was still very poorly , and elizabeth would not quit her at all , till late in the evening , when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep , and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself 	3.0106055389873556
i should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire 	3.1164102820009845
" " oh ! i am not at all afraid of her dying 	3.293474050979807
she was humbled , she was grieved 	3.925188365370094
i do not think it is very pretty 	4.049924601585394
" elizabeth could hardly help smiling , as she assured her that had not been the case 	3.0972972795053577
with astonishment did elizabeth see , that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself 	2.572313693439386
" but when elizabeth told of his silence , it did not seem very likely , even to charlotte ' s wishes , to be the case 	2.827631743264709
an union of a different tendency , and precluding the possibility of the other , was soon to be formed in their family 	2.9300010758675104
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother ' s words , or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper 	2.394718309777521

" every body was surprised 	3.1958504855258028
but the fact is , that being , as i am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place which , however , as i have already said , may not be for several years 	2.5600219483563653
for my part , mr bingley , i always keep servants that can do their own work 	2.608698837074293
" " though it is difficult , " said jane , " to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit 	2.3709669260689035
what say you , mary ? for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know , and read great books , and make extracts 	2.6419794244884653
but every line proved more clearly that the affair , which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent , as to render mr darcy ' s conduct in it less than infamous , was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole 	2.5688073851344453
i pity , though i cannot help blaming her 	3.0885175737672936
" again his astonishment was obvious 	2.9077639024940796
the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door , and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual 	2.4412407975710426
" " mr collins moreover adds , " " i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia ' s sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known 	2.5047599785702563
he will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before 	2.757251006037079
had the late mr darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better 	2.2835384668422596
but jane and elizabeth , who agreed in wishing , for the sake of their sister ' s feelings and consequence , that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents , urged him so earnestly , yet so rationally and so mildly , to receive her and her husband at longbourn , as soon as they were married , that he was prevailed on to think as they thought , and act as they wished 	2.758861727112507
she was teazed by mr collins , who continued most perseveringly by her side , and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again , put it out of her power to dance with others 	3.33393508899194
adieu 	5.919458962890205
your tempers are by no means unlike 	3.5315296662127262
i depend on you for that 	3.0624958151376083
but while he was mortal , there must be a triumph 	3.9284836048468987
and not a note , not a line , did i receive in the mean time 	2.3354930996595185
and his civilities were worn out like his information 	2.5866411081376914
" and of this place , " thought she , " i might have been mistress ! with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted ! instead of viewing them as a stranger , i might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt 	2.5301031590278287
and i trust i am resigned 	3.071747218565335
and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickham ' s attentions 	3.6861573211438357
i was so vexed to see him stand up with her 	3.1716244992863776
" jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern 	2.482643356755797
nothing , therefore , could be fairly conjectured from that , though elizabeth , who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings , was perfectly aware , that , had she known nothing of darcy , she could have borne the dread of lydia ' s infamy somewhat better 	3.102325761245316
yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet 	2.758271900094078
" " i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more 	2.413360401760742

with barefaced questions , ingenious suppositions , and distant surmises 	4.0744327675894585
they look upon it quite as their own , i dare say , whenever that happens 	2.6531758611291334
and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn , and of her stay in derbyshire , so often , and in so hurried a way , as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts 	2.941037468469686
s 	5.992355782248378
" " my dear jane ! " exclaimed elizabeth , " you are too good 	3.233651945859534
chapter ii 	3.5528427098738913
i grieve to find , however , that colonel f 	3.734627171017466
i know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you 	2.4601276082474013
and as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married 	2.138731427032279
we are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb 	3.5304342363149575
i did not expect such a compliment 	3.358756885666042
elizabeth now began to revive 	3.1876816251455264
elizabeth , after slightly surveying it , went to a window to enjoy its prospect 	2.7149400240476025
they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her , and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her , " so , miss eliza , i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham ! your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions 	2.5248680318371783
in which case you may be sure of my pardon 	2.8518181886552263
here , leading the way through every walk and cross walk , and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for , every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind 	2.0084945004124672
his own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , mr wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited 	2.37903026524137
and when mr bennet joined them at supper , his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was 	2.1528827022363726
mr gardiner , highly amused by the kind of family prejudice , to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master , soon led again to the subject 	2.272680033501121
" if he wants our society , let him seek it 	2.4495974543631247
though , as it was no more than she expected , she soon regained her composure , and calmly replied , " why should you be surprised , my dear eliza ? do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any woman ' s good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? " but elizabeth had now recollected herself , and making a strong effort for it , was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her , and that she wished her all imaginable happiness 	2.937210874423112
it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister ' s being in town 	2.4253326437148774
miss bennet ' s pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley 	2.4199824868671334
when , after examining the mother , in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy , she turned her eyes on the daughter , she could almost have joined in maria ' s astonishment , at her being so thin , and so small 	2.5055113337980326
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous 	3.1931282334966276
" chapter v 	3.5083826988037563
it cannot last long 	3.2980874505570807
her keenest attention was awakened 	3.1108466515995334
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence , health , good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at longbourn 	2.159898785161875
too _ , i am afraid 	4.788223388099345
" miss bingley made no answer 	2.763598997645965
the subjection in which his father had brought him up , had given him originally great humility of manner , but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head , living in retirement , and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity 	2.783160248431406
i am not romantic you know 	3.7482910558465914
" she looks sickly and cross 	2.777186103780146
but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal 	3.233681091397165
" elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal 	2.2401041618879898
which brought them again , after some time , in a descent among hanging woods , to the edge of the water , in one of its narrowest parts 	2.892419731463861
and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate 	2.9862136093199805
and tell my dear lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses 	2.5446428098137406
i should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off 	3.1447700997894605
and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary 	2.4908217754555966
she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought 	2.6405960262847143
and , though she was not very sanguine in expecting it , the application was a something to look forward to 	2.847125468161149
and in the evening mrs bennet ' s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter 	2.740542900236362
" to these high flown expressions , elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust 	2.642977639706546
my brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister ' s partiality is not misleading me , i think , when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman ' s heart 	2.610520003468192
" " she is a very good kind of girl , i believe 	3.25856192705507
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them , in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur 	2.4346622805983
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children 	2.990879217213879
you may ask questions , which i shall not choose to answer 	3.1644943993049144
miss bennet accepted her aunt ' s invitation with pleasure 	2.89284350018491
this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father ' s estate 	3.042191413814702
" i cannot make him out 	3.390926593171598
" i am all astonishment 	3.353838613710944
" you may well warn me against such an evil 	2.5985957202462404
" i am glad i bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox ! well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home 	2.410340755434012
she resolved to give her the information herself , and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner , to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family 	2.553616973477731
to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think , than such as did not 	2.2850142133217095
she was received , however , very politely by them 	3.2082495718858546
on applying to see the place , they were admitted into the hall 	3.261290192341688
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough 	2.9826895566375753
i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , i am sure i should be deceived again 	2.4623998108903637
" elizabeth turned away to hide a smile 	3.1857814668868567
" " thank you but i always mend my own 	2.367548880059992
but if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away 	2.6196746218541382
" where is your sister ? " said he hastily , as he opened the door 	3.3038193996876952
and for your own , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way 	2.0310052094365445
she danced four dances with him at meryton 	2.655091470660996
oh ! how acutely did she now feel it 	2.7356819355397124
she remembered also , that till the netherfield family had quitted the country , he had told his story to no one but herself 	2.4009174355738225
" " we are speaking of music , madam , " said he , when no longer able to avoid a reply 	2.66065583235141
" oh ! lizzy , why am i thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! if i could but see you as happy ! if there were but such another man for you ! " " if you were to give me forty such men , i never could be so happy as you 	2.4897160068121815
but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted 	2.7005673645315817
and it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet , i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age 	2.9479564671718355
as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females 	2.4556312198149994
but that after their removal , it had been every where discussed 	2.837834697277908
and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again 	2.2776191799975796
" but , " he added , " you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here 	2.670406463163249
" " what should not you mind ? " " i should not mind any thing at all 	2.8046413287796175
you must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of project gutenberg tm works 	2.154010743557177
she respected , she esteemed , she was grateful to him , she felt a real interest in his welfare 	3.1178982722883224
she received him with her very best politeness , which he returned with as much more , apologising for his intrusion , without any previous acquaintance with her , which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice 	2.6516967624779566
at last she recollected that she had been travelling , and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance 	3.5401214169550124
" 'tis an etiquette i despise , " said he 	3.2143575579571007
your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance 	2.6470182674270206
" mr wickham ' s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife ' s 	2.713127072733168
they could not be untouched by his politeness , and had they drawn his character from their own feelings , and his servant ' s report , without any reference to any other account , the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known , would not have recognised it for mr darcy 	3.018208932144804
" " indeed , mama , you are mistaken , " said elizabeth , blushing for her mother 	3.6690561306682468
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters 	2.3784803957452656
he meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it 	3.8969121984139474
this is my advice 	3.533773406506187
mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm , supposing , by the servant ' s account , that their niece was taken suddenly ill 	2.40992594569499
mr bingley intended it likewise , and sometimes made choice of his county 	2.3801546668314524
project gutenberg is a registered trademark , and may not be used if you charge for the ebooks , unless you receive specific permission 	2.429253384694664
in spite of this amendment , however , she requested to have a note sent to longbourn , desiring her mother to visit jane , and form her own judgment of her situation 	3.4216818782877754
" you may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire , my dear cousin 	2.693655125815721
but it is of small importance 	3.187184225369146
but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic 	2.8612075940691257
her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingley ' s name had been last mentioned between them 	2.5705035358086206
she asked her at different times , how many sisters she had , whether they were older or younger than herself , whether any of them were likely to be married , whether they were handsome , where they had been educated , what carriage her father kept , and what had been her mother ' s maiden name ? elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions , but answered them very composedly 	2.3839481301603622
there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte , and the weather was so fine for the time of year , that she had often great enjoyment out of doors 	2.671603814003809
the more so , as she could bring no proof of its injustice 	2.9449894222670188
i wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise 	2.442306751334882
" mrs bennet and her daughters then departed , and elizabeth returned instantly to jane , leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy 	2.953566847433837
and when she rose to take leave , elizabeth , ashamed of her mother ' s ungracious and reluctant good wishes , and sincerely affected herself , accompanied her out of the room 	2.634280376955803
yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said , " you are mistaken , mr darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner 	2.4367388717420537
mr darcy took her place by her niece , and they walked on together 	3.2001334974159534
on his side even more 	3.7025719345978225
but we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation 	4.384735656576993
your reproof , so well applied , i shall never forget : 'had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner 	2.2506800671195784
i never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united 	3.136051802215034
but lady catherine very resolutely , and not very politely , declined eating any thing 	3.378864572799021
the marriage of a daughter , which had been the first object of her wishes , since jane was sixteen , was now on the point of accomplishment , and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials , fine muslins , new carriages , and servants 	2.3648196257384093
but , stopping on his approach , received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome 	2.1309263970653523
till , roused to resentment by his subsequent language , she lost all compassion in anger 	2.1705872882745276
elizabeth soon heard from her friend 	3.0379211095549152
you never see a fault in any body 	2.7393013265007853
my faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed ! but perhaps , " added he , stopping in his walk , and turning towards her , " these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design 	2.5042902580286115
they went to the library , therefore , and asked their father , whether he would not wish them to make it known to her 	3.1912900570821066
his consenting to marry her is a proof , i will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking 	3.121470702588821
" " his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , " said elizabeth angrily 	2.9041200678038748
" after walking some time in this way , the two ladies in front , the two gentlemen behind , on resuming their places , after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant , there chanced to be a little alteration 	3.0869652306871376
" to catherine and lydia , neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting 	2.484059802353996
lady catherine approached , and , after listening for a few minutes , said to darcy , " miss bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a london master 	3.3179359111907596
" i confess , " said he , " that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship ' s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings 	2.7715941234246877
you sly thing ! well , i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley 	3.4171076223931967
when breakfast was over , they were joined by the sisters 	3.4764009090115047
not lydia only , but all were concerned in it 	2.5597763191170344
but her'_ she thought was still worse 	2.8436523336393957
" " i deserve neither such praise nor such censure , " cried elizabeth 	2.2488635965635186
mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door , and the carriage stopped at the small gate , which led by a short gravel walk to the house , amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party 	2.738203283297763
but she is very young 	3.6399156252875677
not deficient in good humour when they were pleased , nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it 	2.5172955183519985
kitty and me were to spend the day there , and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening 	2.9016751506628435
and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read 	2.9695844806575167
" " i will not be interrupted 	3.539963078729949
" replied her sister 	4.135885348389559
in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master 	2.1984762130254967
my daughters are brought up differently 	2.9530562884197464
but with a moment ' s recollection and a returning smile , replied , that he had formerly seen him often 	2.547423148673808
" a gamester ! " she cried 	4.014598583575706
" " it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire 	2.8242488842484565
he had looked at her without admiration at the ball 	2.928585059893648
his wish of introducing his sister to her , was a compliment of the highest kind 	3.157062010416655
and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham , and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr darcy ' s looks and behaviour 	3.073045752171271
but she sat down , resolving within herself , to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man 	2.438237096075424
i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse 	2.6074822090394627
but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice 	2.917134386156197
" i can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning 	2.867528987552272
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added , " i have never had a cross word from him in my life , and i have known him ever since he was four years old 	2.6769554370551667
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him , nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity 	2.4893634984381277
young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life 	2.2954019986550245
here was knowledge in which no one could partake 	2.9549792961268286
you must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention 	2.6070110905402206
" elizabeth listened in silence , but was not convinced 	2.987803929426006
" " that is very true , " said elizabeth 	2.7539737852596535
but i am particularly attached to these young men 	2.797751369511995
she had even learnt to detect , in the very gentleness which had first delighted her , an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary 	2.714487797290697
" " that is not very likely 	2.9977404880137306
" it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened 	2.3927989604991975
" persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth , this was not the best method of recommending herself 	2.6826373640658088
mr bingley had danced with her twice , and she had been distinguished by his sisters 	3.149757330924243
" " lizzy , " cried her mother , " remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home 	2.5099822575162554
oh ! had i known what i ought , what i dared , to do ! but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much 	2.468674478802332
but she is too much like her brother , very , very proud 	2.9323204757561645
" can it be possible that he will marry her ? " " wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him 	3.205929586634496
and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness 	2.689824135410843
when they were gone , elizabeth , as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy , chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent 	2.6608409210495627
but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere 	3.3256081058101854
and after relating the circumstances , she thus went on : " i am now convinced , my dear aunt , that i have never been much in love 	3.1529508652280827
that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than i could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself 	2.818619186295469
as soon as they were gone , elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits 	2.62269860082083
" " i shall not say that you are mistaken , " he replied , " because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you 	2.716070372653924
" " i did hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present 	3.1941770614226064
mr gardiner declared his willingness , and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation 	2.69190197936179
had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend , she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint 	2.547816240470421
and no less certain is it , that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it 	2.538436222264923
their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! let me never see either one or the other again ! " yet the misery , for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation , received soon afterwards material relief , from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover 	2.086718212825789
and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled , she had all the success she expected 	3.0526969522734873
but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire , she saw him from her dressing room window , enter the paddock , and ride towards the house 	2.3280615004589613
teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind ! no , no i feel he may defy us there 	2.3455725807487355
in her kind schemes for elizabeth , she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam 	2.2834634961195768
" " dining out , " said mrs bennet , " that is very unlucky 	3.6339283621980836
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water , and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground , or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching 	2.1489561679417615
your ' s , &c 	3.257817285766595
and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room 	2.361459920249184
and what claims has lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , i am not able to judge 	2.306636092116279
and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin 	2.5315696486499513
colonel forster will , i dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head 	2.872953406413821
elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley 	2.1284489829676025
my sisters may write to me 	3.154282748653808
" " you need not distress yourself 	2.9295955703919168
but i make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves 	2.3782908647863925
let me hear from you very soon 	3.182709875254271
for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting 	2.2604512621751702
and very unwillingly said so 	3.1615185276832842
or , as the happiest alternative , been secluded from the world , in some distant farm house 	3.3536360797271625
wont it , kitty ? " kitty owned that she had rather stay at home 	3.0348615645732147
but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general , since jane united with great strength of feeling , a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner , which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent 	2.2814099843803994
but do not imagine that he is always here so often 	3.213531454041789
" in spite of what her sister declared , and really believed to be her feelings , in the expectation of his arrival , elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it 	2.758722558852383
" " your humility , mr bingley , " said elizabeth , " must disarm reproof 	3.067300587485558
it was then disclosed in the following manner 	3.982117194737023
other books were produced , and after some deliberation he chose fordyce ' s sermons 	2.6176417843217767
" oh , yes ! if one could but go to brighton ! but papa is so disagreeable 	2.165505473161356
" elizabeth did not know what to make of it 	3.228948037586299
to mr bennet ' s acknowledgments he briefly replied , with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family 	2.9093710749982016
" the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret 	2.9288150766781826
she answered with equal indifference and brevity , and the other said no more 	3.3534440207262883
" i often think , " said she , " that there is nothing so bad as parting with one ' s friends 	2.993619062231632
he could number the fields in every direction , and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump 	2.5905656598417686
" " i beg your pardon , " replied miss bingley , turning away with a sneer 	2.9835334359959305
" with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content 	3.06855245224754
and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia , her uncle ' s interference seemed of the utmost importance , and till he entered the room , the misery of her impatience was severe 	2.4811743384201232
my watchfulness has been effectual 	3.8814624051229187
<num>	4.24676143746824
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say 	3.186724601699433
but i was over ruled , as i always am 	3.8459476636846563
the business of her life was to get her daughters married 	2.7737296794347017
" he continued after a pause , on seeing bingley join the group 	2.4608316054230435
that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side , and that if it were , it must belong to mr darcy , the superior in consequence , to begin the acquaintance 	2.9406063177918664
its business office is located at <num> north <num> west , salt lake city , ut <num>, ( <num> ) <num> <num>	2.9258888111242585
but he saw only the father 	2.959498084480892
" what can be the meaning of this ! " said charlotte , as soon as he was gone 	3.200143168321441
in spite of having been at st 	3.314769666418282
in lydia ' s imagination , a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness 	2.750273701549636
" but how could that be ? how could his will be disregarded ? why did not you seek legal redress ? " " there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law 	2.9740288047679493
i have suspected it some time , but i am now convinced 	3.627600024944475
elizabeth tried to be diverted by them 	4.647230928146797
" " i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever 	2.5193727462652817
but these things happen so often ! a young man , such as you describe mr bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent 	2.8294573905937876
she grew absolutely ashamed of herself 	2.8606629245919883
the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing , or on the evenness of his lines , or on the length of his letter , with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received , formed a curious dialogue , and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each 	3.0665587311712055
and to prevent its ever happening again , took care to inform him at first , that it was a favourite haunt of hers 	2.9606166561083986
and she could hardly suppress a smile , at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people , against whom his pride had revolted , in his offer to herself 	2.5195104194567226
he did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business 	2.951796835786222
had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt , to my own family ! had his character been known , this could not have happened 	2.5276402258785176
and i am sure if i had been you , i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it 	2.9295012498630415
mr collins was gratified 	3.5265976336591853
lady lucas herself has often said so , and envied me jane ' s beauty 	3.1849820199602616
and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure , it added to the hope of the future 	2.1756224885615967
i am impatient to see him 	3.463117902579037
" " that you certainly shall 	3.1259720659489516
he has more to give 	3.335109969647424
a favourite with her mother , whose affection had brought her into public at an early age 	2.6326506602040123
and if she were married to him to morrow , i should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth 	2.7678871404121015
and though this was not exactly the case , the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr denny , to whom lydia eagerly applied , and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before , and was not yet returned 	2.5539280601356964
well , my comfort is , i am sure jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done 	2.7354642435192043
though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood 	3.797720033711654
but you have chosen your fault well 	2.706551724918419
and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation 	2.182596663805646
and to complete the view , she saw herself seated beneath a tent , tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once 	2.9574002312589283
very nonsensical to come at all ! why must she be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? her hair so untidy , so blowsy ! " " yes , and her petticoat 	2.8177093382091827
it will pass away soon enough 	2.8881486439506228
let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions 	2.690757638080412
" elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection , but its meaning did not escape , nor was it likely to conciliate her 	2.4915793417655845
" " but if you have got them to day , " said elizabeth , " my mother ' s purpose will be answered 	3.165741215116388
after this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt 	2.5774699588066827
but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine 	3.223424388717699
and the two , who were most anxiously expected , to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen , were in very good time 	3.259254505710734
but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it , and making her sister the excuse , said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book 	2.2698614171631233
but he seemed to like his second better 	2.9286709133068993
" of what are you talking ? " " of mr collins and lizzy 	3.8856099706193548
nay , when i read a letter of his , i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham , much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law 	2.619390179204338
she looked at jane , and smiled , and shook her head by turns 	2.812941086964216
elizabeth bennet had been obliged , by the scarcity of gentlemen , to sit down for two dances 	3.1949048345504125
" not at all 	3.6570942080054354
and , turning to elizabeth , said , " miss eliza bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room 	2.7003064377745822
gratitude , not merely for having once loved her , but for loving her still well enough , to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him , and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection 	3.0662620435607675
" " certainly , " he replied , biting his lips 	3.027103573304618
girls , can i do any thing for you in meryton ? oh ! here comes hill 	2.5414871539496913
we must not all expect jane ' s good fortune 	3.359938550874122
but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame 	2.5113617686994387
there was good humour and kindness 	3.233933937028372
after a slight preparation for good news , the letter was read aloud 	2.5192977078997814
but , instead of the expected summons , when they approached her , she said to miss bennet , " i beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so i took the liberty of coming to ask 	2.8394484585333957
when the card tables were placed , he had an opportunity of obliging her in return , by sitting down to whist 	2.3383819006216933
" can you come to morrow ? " yes , he had no engagement at all for to morrow 	2.884451094976772
and her neighbours at lucas lodge , therefore , ( for through their communication with the collinses , the report she concluded had reached lady catherine ) had only set that down , as almost certain and immediate , which she had looked forward to as possible , at some future time 	2.0085602640728037
in half a minute the letter was unfolded again , and collecting herself as well as she could , she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham , and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence 	3.2143178697263903
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning , and writing to jane , while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village , when she was startled by a ring at the door , the certain signal of a visitor 	2.8010394358681956
i guessed as much 	3.4378213487411884
we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice 	2.312477363980617
in this perturbed state of mind , with thoughts that could rest on nothing , she walked on 	2.440189391604574
elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants 	3.256897498692921
the day passed most pleasantly away 	2.819391082566833
" for my own part , " she rejoined , " i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her 	3.2372893015742243
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede 	2.321921944685428
what a triumph for him , as she often thought , could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago , would now have been gladly and gratefully received ! he was as generous , she doubted not , as the most generous of his sex 	2.5512747555941537
but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement 	3.068739695740841
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined 	3.001022271876211
talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife 	2.2184431880362494
it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline ' s interested wishes , and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes , however openly or artfully spoken , could influence a young man so totally independent of every one 	2.715515633911147
<num>	4.24676143746824
the two youngest of the family , catherine and lydia , were particularly frequent in these attentions 	2.7758472295036363
" i am going to open the instrument , eliza , and you know what follows 	2.9232386397104033
" " but i was embarrassed 	3.483779586759472
because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth 	2.791077534832859
and since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left meryton greatly in debt 	2.79015389825652
will you hear it ? " " most willingly 	3.670875058204914
with his notions of dignity , he would probably feel that the arguments , which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous , contained much good sense and solid reasoning 	2.115236763868428
but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations , and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient , when required to depend on his affection for her , for a woman who had already refused him , as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham 	2.431855320500549
she was met in the vestibule by lydia , who , flying to her , cried in a half whisper , " i am glad you are come , for there is such fun here ! what do you think has happened this morning ? mr collins has made an offer to lizzy , and she will not have him 	2.669106619006146
but no one can throw any blame on them 	2.517265268323991
but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better 	2.310191345262041
she had always seen it with pain 	2.91318479340022
he never said a great deal , nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much 	2.550338717405131
" in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable , and jane to make her resigned 	3.061638785366053
and by a manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone , which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family 	2.526018652989289
chapter xiv 	2.740340420276896
" " compared with some families , i believe we were 	2.9263621652032836
only look at her 	3.7303165832261103
" but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago 	3.0109702721222074
and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters , in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about 	2.32477406711805
lady catherine ' s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts 	2.743656036223533
" he must be an oddity , i think , " said she 	4.480713687147883
mr collins was not a sensible man , and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society 	2.952625590026422
she wrote even to jane on the occasion , to express her delight , and repeat all her former professions of regard 	2.3753391024302255
and how lydia could ever have attached him , had appeared incomprehensible 	2.5131385220983065
he found her as handsome as she had been last year 	3.589195746109959
" " believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention 	2.390771738912414
but above all , above respect and esteem , there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked 	2.510549220206487
this unfortunate affair will , i fear , prevent my sister ' s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day 	2.6913811278177966
and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley , in spite of that pollution which its woods had received , not merely from the presence of such a mistress , but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city 	2.6160740450203503
if i was to go through the world , i could not meet with a better 	3.2683874719762396
her aunt asked her , smilingly , how she liked it 	3.6052718257056453
" another intreaty that she would be serious , however , produced the desired effect 	2.987389691649203
but the gloom of lydia ' s prospect was shortly cleared away 	2.664889287186863
therefore , stay quietly at longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care 	2.9718675811281208
international donations are gratefully accepted , but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the united states 	2.07162412357297
and elizabeth , after all the misery of the morning , found herself , in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed , seated in the carriage , and on the road to longbourn 	3.3206315677466045
project gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify , do copyright research on , transcribe and proofread public domain works in creating the project gutenberg tm collection 	2.9457076992048727
i am confident that she would have performed delightfully 	3.2565733126437033
and , above all things , keep mr bennet from fighting 	2.3909093878483425
and , therefore , abruptly changing the conversation , talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage 	2.834475482233936
i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them 	2.991718704207911
he was lively and unreserved , danced every dance , was angry that the ball closed so early , and talked of giving one himself at netherfield 	1.9859037353429554
" the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennet ' s visit , and determining when they should ask him to dinner 	2.804108557622061
and when bingley was gone , jane constantly sought the same means of relief 	2.3953346257373305
without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person 	2.934607774500242
of his former way of life , nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself 	2.355744653358316
it distressed her a little , and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage 	3.0738049985992175
but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped , by the sister at least 	2.935464289132235
all that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister 	2.405434445661543
it was an evening of no common delight to them all 	2.5807921829640845
she enquired into charlotte ' s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely , and gave her a great deal of advice , as to the management of them all 	2.551092141500518
and , as he had likewise foretold , he took his seat at the bottom of the table , by her ladyship ' s desire , and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater 	2.795682366789901
as she had heard no carriage , she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine , and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions , when the door opened , and to her very great surprise , mr darcy , and mr darcy only , entered the room 	2.6197133690178864
how could she deny that credit to his assertions , in one instance , which she had been obliged to give in the other ? he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister ' s attachment 	2.836584979788549
her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister , of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken , and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious , as bingley had now been gone a week , and nothing was heard of his return 	2.285770833031086
lydia was a stout , well grown girl of fifteen , with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance 	2.790922780680904
assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom , rather than a compliment to his aunt 	2.3046613474040525
their reception at home was most kind 	2.9149120033050333
he has a very satirical eye , and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself , i shall soon grow afraid of him 	3.1374019098147397
elizabeth ' s mind was too full for conversation , but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view 	2.2851867368616463
she was not sorry , however , to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung 	2.935327135728631
and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! it would be such a delicious scheme , and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all 	2.6698929402182734
and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in london , than in scotland 	2.8620933272237554
to kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected 	3.7419702499689027
" elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand 	2.58432490845921
" and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit 	2.302460402229274
" " but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side , " said jane 	3.0295095676110018
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration , and gave most gracious smiles , especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them 	2.0166818082974136
for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement , they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning , from all those who were not immediately on the spot 	2.24090142777985
arguments are too much like disputes 	3.2704933098921445
" " i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind 	2.295468967814162
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay , as they had been at first 	2.957356199689708
and all for the sake of mr collins too ! why should he have it more than anybody else ? " " i leave it to yourself to determine , " said mr bennet 	2.7534507017444607
and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first , and was in a way to be very much in love 	2.7849176047749102
" darcy was fixed in astonishment 	2.991793251625967
but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly 	2.448229281132783
it exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life 	2.1671293043243995
in nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew more affection than she feels 	2.191225230730887
and though more astonished than gratified herself , by this effect of her charms , it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her 	2.310338103892091
he bore it with noble indifference , and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy , had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy , with an expression of half laughing alarm 	3.012566227268644
and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance 	3.200245551824296
" " are they indeed ? " cried elizabeth , with the greatest satisfaction 	3.2786669643785897
but really , ma'am , i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early 	2.5329565420316116
mr darcy replied with great intrepidity , " miss elizabeth bennet 	3.8320817902390045
" elizabeth passed quietly out of the room , jane and kitty followed , but lydia stood her ground , determined to hear all she could 	2.275120490315652
" " i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him , i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this ! " after a few minutes reflection , however , she continued , " i do remember his boasting one day , at netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper 	3.0480143144131437
very little was said by either 	3.067633553229495
your ' s , very sincerely , " m 	3.2482213013887944
and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs bennet ' s heart , but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property 	2.3454994904328936
she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter , and , without knowing or considering what their income might be , rejected many as deficient in size and importance 	2.3008937243321284
the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth 	4.46085054023566
and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves , and meanly of others 	3.1237860904737134
she then took a large house in edward street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings 	2.499735474746173
but it is not sound 	3.909761576054252
" " but , my dear sister , can i be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? " " you must decide for yourself , " said elizabeth , " and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , i advise you by all means to refuse him 	2.5428256001878933
and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person ( lady lucas ) freely , openly , and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley 	2.3199121482599385
" " this is no very striking resemblance of your own character , i am sure , " said he 	2.8509304371814435
she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else 	2.7978831030271722
no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there 	2.1187468578727024
he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield , and she blushed as she answered , " i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family 	3.079874048269481
mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs philips , and she ventured , without any permission , to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton 	2.7533832566788554

as her successor in that house , she regarded her with jealous abhorrence 	2.7231804960475343
" i am astonished , my dear , " said mrs bennet , " that you should be so ready to think your own children silly 	3.1794495147977626
and , having nothing else to say , was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him 	2.8279362793894647
he is his own master 	3.2863546409677618
" that is all very proper and civil , i am sure , " said mrs bennet , " and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman 	3.3835487884220616
it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night 	2.8016451248007637
he was quite young , wonderfully handsome , extremely agreeable , and to crown the whole , he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party 	3.087541088909703
my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me 	2.8118513264851313
mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park , but feared it might be beyond a walk 	2.3578560932886194
that he was surprised by the connexion was evident 	4.268362284091153
" the boy protested that she should not 	2.946153124185676
nobody can tell what i suffer ! but it is always so 	3.1452621495412174
in the afternoon , the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves 	3.1334886195757665
" " my dear , " replied her husband , " i have two small favours to request 	3.5515216733620223
if i had ever learnt , i should have been a great proficient 	4.173856632202374
and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature , by the testimony so highly in his favour , and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light , which yesterday had produced 	2.169498330879095
chapter x 	2.740340420276896
his appearance was greatly in his favour 	3.0136961048726625
and there was no necessity for such attention 	3.1299453855278085
she had never seen a place for which nature had done more , or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste 	2.2656508462773552

you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper 	2.753286301300077
it became her turn to listen 	3.087023092598822
" let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size 	2.7502132188448796
by you , i was properly humbled 	4.025125916997839
" " pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? where does discretion end , and avarice begin ? last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent 	2.4349779494701673
" elizabeth listened , wondered , doubted , and was impatient for more 	2.480596090109054

" come here , child , " cried her father as she appeared 	2.9510350246015054
and now we are better 	3.3652619887524677
do your sisters play and sing ? " " one of them does 	3.228722254093948
" mary , though pretending not to hear , was somewhat disconcerted 	2.955546068701809
at length the parsonage was discernible 	2.9298503504926474
where else can they be so well concealed ? " " and lydia used to want to go to london , " added kitty 	2.854424664743253
but it would not do 	3.848817939566231
i did not wink at you 	3.712276434999201
" if it were merely a fine house richly furnished , " said she , " i should not care about it myself 	3.4250464109626404
and as she named their relationship to herself , she stole a sly look at him , to see how he bore it 	3.2835246208398616
it has been most unconsciously done , however , and i hope will be of short duration 	3.5971259320490843
" good gracious ! lord bless me ! only think ! dear me ! mr darcy ! who would have thought it ! and is it really true ? oh ! my sweetest lizzy ! how rich and how great you will be ! what pin money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! jane ' s is nothing to it nothing at all 	2.2040901955453878
whether he had been aware of jane ' s attachment , or whether it had escaped his observation 	2.8982016276369444
on their being joined by mr bingley himself , elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas 	2.6918313252461967
nothing of the past was recollected with pain 	3.046634796179917
nothing had ever suggested it before , but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter , than by supposing a partiality for their niece 	2.438169537417862
and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to 	2.6416140008061606
as she went up stairs to get ready , mrs bennet followed her , saying , " i am quite sorry , lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself 	2.7220435527673117
but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts , fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one , with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance 	2.779902324480129
an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope , that by the following christmas , she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day , unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office , another regiment should be quartered in meryton 	2.142482104328627
" " he likes to have his own way very well , " replied colonel fitzwilliam 	3.1708542119527277
" " la ! you are so strange ! but i must tell you how it went off 	2.7152272385066194
[ illustration : a vicarage house 	2.819669747053202
" lady catherine hesitated for a moment , and then replied , " the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind 	2.9027203285833725
at night she opened her heart to jane 	2.724550901803069
a man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing 	2.4046092398678716
now and then , they were honoured with a call from her ladyship , and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits 	2.8181112291699906
" " yes , sir 	3.0046559225986367
and when mr wickham walked into the room , elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before , nor thinking of him since , with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration 	2.6181139279131553
and , though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense , since the disturbers of her brain were removed , her other sister , from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended , was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance , by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp 	2.5743544592242067
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters 	2.339538416900059
" she burst into tears as she alluded to it , and for a few minutes could not speak another word 	2.6695743334930984
for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as i could 	2.645417063814133
to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement 	2.821149932310101
she answered him with cold civility 	3.0648975159539256
and sir william gave it as his decided opinion , that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate , it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st 	2.189100501926167
" how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter ! " he made no answer 	2.206329570115526
and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs , to think of any thing else 	3.3427486449251864
lydia , my love , though you are the youngest , i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball 	2.613880086793543
i know not what to think 	3.1651507420037435
" mr wickham ' s attention was caught 	3.3423409783079268
nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation 	2.1587973840603416
" " undoubtedly 	3.462685917351293
and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant 	2.5597985700287396
in talking over their route the evening before , mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again 	2.479917192038995
" " why did not you all learn ? you ought all to have learned 	2.3487914268760592
see paragraph <num>	3.9135284529609478
and from her correspondence with her sister , there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty , though rather longer , were much too full of lines under the words to be made public 	2.276527593292774
" elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal , and felt persuaded of her sister ' s ready acquiescence 	2.4573468782399863
" mr and mrs gardiner smiled 	3.495705931713083
" " not the slightest 	3.6804057179939953
" come , darcy , " said he , " i must have you dance 	4.093451982783538
" i have no reason , i assure you , " said he , " to be dissatisfied with my reception 	3.088185066513185
if , as i conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement 	2.526843332298408
however , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were 	3.730234359497891
that is all to be forgot 	3.6931721227223133
there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded , and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time 	2.8556532720914976
" my dear father , i congratulate you 	3.1491806267640263
but is it certain , absolutely certain ? " " oh yes ! they left brighton together on sunday night , and were traced almost to london , but not beyond 	2.5783490308294343
but if i go on , i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem 	2.580101353573963
every thing being settled between them , mr darcy ' s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home 	2.7798599019053687
and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield 	2.7002258848648566
forgive me 	4.745652643152869
i cannot understand it 	3.640616388441173
and i should be miserable to forfeit it 	3.5246807265124316
and her mother was too happy , to be quite so obstinate as usual 	3.2250514102741286
if it was not for the entail i should not mind it 	3.481080535038604
the reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as i have given above 	3.1382906567344047
his attachment to rosings , certainly increases 	3.2809405992457386
i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one 	2.940056718325859
it was too early in the morning for visitors , and besides , the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours 	2.8245559953201176
i remain , dear sir , with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters , your well wisher and friend , william collins 	2.386564039434499
it was over at last however 	2.9371201823624893
but when the servants were withdrawn , he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest , and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine , by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness 	2.5655460806824903
jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends , and the attentions of their brother 	3.1390803084189844
brother in law of wickham ! every kind of pride must revolt from the connection 	2.90304947347885
" " indeed you are mistaken 	3.2386067272125687
mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off 	2.4967107605385377
" " and they must marry ! yet he is such a man ! " " yes , yes , they must marry 	3.076015568194782
they called at various times of the morning , sometimes separately , sometimes together , and now and then accompanied by their aunt 	2.4029981057074417
and she could not help remembering what charlotte ' s opinion had always been 	3.2333982493660707
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose , the tables were broke up , the carriage was offered to mrs collins , gratefully accepted , and immediately ordered 	2.372059753426827
i have done with you from this very day 	2.854500632371567
i want to be told whether i ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham ' s character 	2.661584539318288
and in his manner of bidding her adieu , wishing her every enjoyment , reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh , and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide , there was a solicitude , an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard 	2.6450344536750205
on the following monday , mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife , who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn 	2.8589071301701225
to mrs gardiner , wickham had one means of affording pleasure , unconnected with his general powers 	2.7960327687105306
yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over 	2.023739623978573
the feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation 	2.345358871648865
and her features are not at all handsome 	3.3061557357495763
my sister , i am sure , will not hear of her removal 	3.556883191202871
to pemberley , therefore , they were to go 	4.8738237896575995
after amusing himself some time with their curiosity , he thus explained 	2.3381961329495717
the moral will be perfectly fair 	2.9879477039547715
he is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably 	3.4752838837390363
" with my mother up stairs 	3.0219822844676343
a lady ' s imagination is very rapid 	3.232414474209005
" i have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear sir 	3.274898151563132
my dear , dear lydia ! how merry we shall be together when we meet ! " her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports , by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardiner ' s behaviour laid them all under 	2.311074483776616
for though feeling almost secure , and with reason , for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging , he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday 	2.8158715155156835
my poor father ! how he must have felt it ! " " i never saw any one so shocked 	3.026326791405365
her colour changed , and she said no more 	3.4798826010837494
" " did you go by the village of kympton ? " " i do not recollect that we did 	2.8818340677754803
you have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert 	2.26246124067854
chapter xiv 	2.740340420276896
" " well , and what news does it bring ? good or bad ? " " what is there of good to be expected ? " said he , taking the letter from his pocket 	2.6696631570624105
and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement , she could , perhaps , believe , that remaining partiality for her , might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned 	2.460051666033189
with the gardiners , they were always on the most intimate terms 	3.1572411798153808
and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again 	2.4712179605862143
i was ready to die of laughter 	3.1379121472941227
and with no one to speak to , of what i felt , no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had ! oh ! how i wanted you ! " " how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy , for now they do appear wholly undeserved 	2.4986197456453723
for , besides the immediate embarrassment , there were other evils before her 	2.5300536365451864
i wish you had been there 	3.2667922796263302
elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest , and then , sick of this folly , took refuge in her own room , that she might think with freedom 	2.9110250383909295
" " i should like balls infinitely better , " she replied , " if they were carried on in a different manner 	2.611100541388158
but so we all were 	3.5348969043045773
chapter xvi 	3.554720655478363
" " but not before they went to brighton ? " " no , i believe not 	3.1040961591144285
" catherine was disconcerted , and made no answer 	2.4996674119112123
" i have not seen her for many years , but i very well remember that i never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent 	3.1083708760261377
" mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies 	2.4822167863424363
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them 	2.8103766427681953
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched 	3.1195281559300483
that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment , as to refuse his daughter a privilege , without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid , exceeded all that she could believe possible 	2.7131712529479457
widely different was the effect of a second perusal 	2.8159985747866245
one , that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief 	3.46588441442615
elizabeth , on her side , had much to do 	3.233719321115437
" " you are then resolved to have him ? " " i have said no such thing 	2.784020684859966
many smiled 	4.574791489847329
he who , she had been persuaded , would avoid her as his greatest enemy , seemed , on this accidental meeting , most eager to preserve the acquaintance , and without any indelicate display of regard , or any peculiarity of manner , where their two selves only were concerned , was soliciting the good opinion of her friends , and bent on making her known to his sister 	2.513159738622686
" he is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , " said her uncle 	2.8004054636008324
daughters are never of so much consequence to a father 	2.6069872260345837
the hill , crowned with wood , from which they had descended , receiving increased abruptness from the distance , was a beautiful object 	2.5303571089554797
" edw 	4.33909710070551
" " i have heard much of your master ' s fine person , " said mrs gardiner , looking at the picture 	2.776283084903976
" " yes , very indifferent indeed , " said elizabeth , laughingly 	3.155960210112788
" " neglect ! i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place 	2.4012048669400414
when she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner ' s in town , so much in love with her , that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away 	2.871833968706222
and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own , it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance 	3.1041147337841206
bingley was by no means deficient , but darcy was clever 	2.747977066712466
they all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses 	4.043270559213445
" " and what is fifty miles of good road ? little more than half a day ' s journey 	2.2668939493364033
when they were all in the drawing room , the questions which elizabeth had already asked , were of course repeated by the others , and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give 	2.6989053305044153
she could not determine how her mother would take it 	2.7833215650965815
for else they will be destitute enough 	3.4171488749728107
mrs bennet had many grievances to relate , and much to complain of 	2.792856784263389
but now , as soon as they were alone together , she said , " i saw you look at me to day , lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report 	2.9735461002767805
he must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on 	3.8325720338389404
seriously , however , she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman ' s concurrence 	2.8333928669226274
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way 	2.4063951535509225
they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride 	2.373189449924632
does she live near you , sir ? " " the garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from rosings park , her ladyship ' s residence 	2.5076952529419714
the consequence of it is , that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have , and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever 	2.8419237213311233
" " yes 	2.6895785044543086
so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself 	3.365405492514131
" her daughters listened in silence to this effusion , sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation 	2.177875387378956
from elizabeth ' s thoughts it was never absent 	3.5500858998632983
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister 	3.008688858063738
it had come with a fare from london 	3.5902682865361895
" " has she been presented ? i do not remember her name among the ladies at court 	2.60484326990758
he shook his head when i expressed my hopes , and said he feared w 	2.6264771158186218
<num>	4.24676143746824
i was uncomfortable enough 	3.323588384585801
" " how strange ! " cried elizabeth 	3.133383878750414
if an individual work is in the public domain in the united states and you are located in the united states , we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying , distributing , performing , displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to project gutenberg are removed 	2.1453557231509386
from thence to the library 	5.8619875247024815
" " true 	3.015247554755662
but i have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected 	2.7241746037783585
and after various conjectures , they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do , which was the more probable from the time of year 	2.3558581006833874
the express was sent off directly 	2.9356871523291663
wretched , wretched , mistake ! " darcy made no answer 	2.40937406701894
not equal to lydia ' s for him 	4.082100775273485
" upon my word , " said mrs gardiner , " i begin to be of your uncle ' s opinion 	3.6908317440871685
and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane 	2.397383838318249
it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it 	3.0708335141229393
at that ball , while i had the honour of dancing with you , i was first made acquainted , by sir william lucas ' s accidental information , that bingley ' s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage 	2.735564757220201
as for the gentleman himself , his feelings were chiefly expressed , not by embarrassment or dejection , or by trying to avoid her , but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence 	2.3541029308854626
there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh , i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters 	2.5737258813115473
" and she rose as she spoke 	2.929195648963789
at such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable 	3.466591307121477
there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping , i dare say 	2.6720953129983283
it is too long ago 	3.260046234448842
my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped 	2.631156917619592
" when the dancing recommenced , however , and darcy approached to claim her hand , charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence 	2.592590840368439
conjectures as to the meaning of it , rapid and wild , hurried into her brain 	3.154172355871252
her ladyship ' s carriage is regularly ordered for us 	2.8600169971140343
" elizabeth obeyed , and running into her own room for her parasol , attended her noble guest down stairs 	2.409703163938774
mr bingley and jane were standing together , a little detached from the rest , and talked only to each other 	3.074804261531491
" dear sir , " i must trouble you once more for congratulations 	3.210655866417496
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party 	3.5519815693816543
" occupied in observing mr bingley ' s attentions to her sister , elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend 	2.956312476868537
they were , therefore , to go 	3.950563966711965
" " oh ! certainly , " said elizabeth , though burning with curiosity 	3.3030036677227725
i have met with two instances lately 	2.8890148710105312
the discomposure of spirits , which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into , could not be easily overcome 	2.612747772125764
" but it is not merely this affair , " she continued , " on which my dislike is founded 	2.7432527653739402
" you look pale 	3.6618297662581663
" how nicely we are crammed in ! " cried lydia 	2.987345359337452
i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner 	2.342208856118531
" i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do 	2.990777145646841
" " you know nothing of the matter 	2.7778069985849205
that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer 	2.736287608504716
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family , without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman ' s conduct 	2.6425882503741747
but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming , she had no wish of her recovering immediately , as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield 	2.5178661084625285
but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures , every idea gave way to the charm of recollection 	2.668470383569141
you have delighted us long enough 	2.9403423419015158
and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london 	2.309741829179503
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! i remember , as soon as ever i saw him , when he first came into hertfordshire last year , i thought how likely it was that you should come together 	2.5309179702261426
" " no , indeed , i did not 	3.6434596017338854
his style was not penitent , but haughty 	4.025814091178128
and i could wish , miss bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either 	2.5676828782437213
i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments 	2.22558880190844
but why did not you tell me so before ? if i had known as much this morning , i certainly would not have called on him 	2.8303125349467972
will you do me the honour of reading that letter ? " and then , with a slight bow , turned again into the plantation , and was soon out of sight 	3.154949890177273
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use 	2.183955173365409
and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet 	2.628279676477169
and poor mr darcy ! dear lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered 	2.9171215564487345
his family knew him to be on all common occasions , a most negligent and dilatory correspondent , but at such a time , they had hoped for exertion 	3.3834445433384635
<num>	4.24676143746824
" " you are quite right 	3.0248001697436675
to this speech bingley made no answer 	2.6433100410011106
and she told me that it was certain true 	3.6408928744929954
it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us 	2.549290831548059
and without any intention of coming back again 	3.1219950111218564
the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia , depended less on any single event , or any particular person , for though they each , like elizabeth , meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham , he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them , and a ball was at any rate , a ball 	2.4256913475910626
i desire you will stay where you are 	2.893300304575434
he had rather hoped that all his wife ' s views on the stranger would be disappointed 	2.2249418332993307
whilst wandering on in this slow manner , they were again surprised , and elizabeth ' s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first , by the sight of mr darcy approaching them , and at no great distance 	3.4880621544280483
i dare say i shall soon see them here 	3.0057588921235294
i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements 	2.6516700370783206
" i have every reason in the world to think ill of you 	3.0308730562762114
it was kindly meant 	3.290540305905775
jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention 	2.4595398896694425
she saw with the creative eye of fancy , the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers 	3.2219134586723044
i must speak to hill , this moment 	2.8441907076289987
lydia came to us 	3.5888213672319607
i have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare 	2.7610384617888193
you are a gentleman ' s daughter 	3.4395340614211944
" " an unhappy alternative is before you , elizabeth 	2.5154039118955582
" well , lizzy , " continued her mother soon afterwards , " and so the collinses live very comfortable , do they ? well , well , i only hope it will last 	2.720472318571675
she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done , and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct 	3.7055152661254667
he answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of lady catherine ' s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily 	2.9627161218846325
the gentlemen being out , they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere 	2.7729901930634293
anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn 	3.2470816557168716
his marriage was now fast approaching , and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable , and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she " wished they might be happy 	2.4779438626724937
mary was obliged to mix more with the world , but she could still moralize over every morning visit 	2.85995244797338
see paragraph <num>	3.9135284529609478
it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate 	2.4800056408228794
and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke , joined to the circumstance itself , and many of the circumstances of the preceding day , opened to them a new idea on the business 	2.2365551950636626
the ladies were somewhat more fortunate , for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window , that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse 	2.921896311331295
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject 	2.6441751261642445
every thing nourishes what is strong already 	3.1769347195438162
" " i beg you would not put it into lizzy ' s head to be vexed by his ill treatment 	2.0931694958007263
as for myself , it is many , many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner 	3.0090381627662355
" elizabeth could not refuse , though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit 	2.7705232078132913
at length , quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book , which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his , she gave a great yawn and said , " how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book ! when i have a house of my own , i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library 	2.582204105478959
and lydia , self willed and careless , would scarcely give them a hearing 	3.2321657560280954
" " in marrying your nephew , i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere 	2.614802444040054
society , i own , is necessary to me 	2.8581180032635953
i thank you , again and again , for not going to the lakes 	3.119969284243146
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford , every eye was in search of the parsonage , and every turning expected to bring it in view 	2.2540758086644113
but jane was very composedly talking to bingley 	2.718150779379322
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible 	2.5337785709226246
the sanguine hope of good , however , which the benevolence of her heart suggested , had not yet deserted her 	3.0950595401020267
elizabeth would not observe her 	3.5195315583262716
" " when i wrote that letter , " replied darcy , " i believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit 	2.7244905574485565
she was more alive to the disgrace , which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter ' s nuptials , than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham , a fortnight before they took place 	2.552919831028044
and on her pausing , he asked her , if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends 	3.6761021582643583
and elizabeth , agitated and confused , rather knew that she was happy , than felt herself to be so 	2.776935908168005
she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever 	2.4054540032901537
he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant 	3.2373405670520863
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , i am sure you did 	2.9573273988777053
one knows exactly what to think 	3.034890468302039
" but to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable 	2.2191401256376757
that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation , than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance 	2.5776966151705794
had she merely dined with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite 	3.207110197534438
" " it may do very well for the others , " replied mr bingley 	2.971585637009564
elizabeth was not comfortable 	3.6189419047924907
at such a moment , the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth , though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought , when she saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband 	3.109556675844164
his debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! oh ! it must be my uncle ' s doings ! generous , good man , i am afraid he has distressed himself 	3.145738724567255
why should they try to influence him ? they can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it 	2.4990999520429837
it is done , however , and it was done for the best 	3.558080441903211
after honestly telling her what she thought , she thus went on : " you are too sensible a girl , lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it 	2.5241323423367543
i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so 	3.7852800039056986
she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses , which he had already had the honour of preaching before her 	3.4438014641472248
there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! such an openness and gentleness in his manner 	2.3237007193398886
jane was as much gratified by this , as her mother could be , though in a quieter way 	3.348007740014362
" " no governess ! how was that possible ? five daughters brought up at home without a governess ! i never heard of such a thing 	2.3114458105745643
bingley , from this time , was of course a daily visitor at longbourn 	2.744359834884372
and on his return , brought back , with great satisfaction , a message from her ladyship , importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her 	2.5239420718658434
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish , self reproach , she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness 	2.5709842524414137
it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hour ' s acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment 	2.337977703269673
" " mr darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , we are scarcely less eager to meet her again 	2.8362335395609457
his regiment is there 	3.606254961650228
and she was quite decided at last , that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride , and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister 	3.660398137158052
by nature inoffensive , friendly and obliging , his presentation at st 	2.2475289345434106
" i have seen them both 	3.5127092021554547
i wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent 	2.8556495688512014
" " to walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! what could she mean by it ? it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum 	2.3965430748150345
" elizabeth ' s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight 	2.555623714691422
when the gentlemen rose to go away , mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility , and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time 	3.2159519751430468
and then , unwilling to let the subject drop , added , " he is a man of very large property in derbyshire , i understand 	2.885746151617577
nor could she for many hours , learn to think of it less than incessantly 	2.729807567059717
those who chose to be idle , certainly might 	2.8365618073563086
" sure he will not leave london before he has found them 	2.7223420468079502
" this will not do , " said elizabeth 	3.4511470689058075
he looked serious as usual 	3.092722226789932
" he made no answer , and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance , when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton 	2.665752306699014
you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe 	2.725372113307813
elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival , that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks , and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer , his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties , and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley ' s designs on him were , by his behaviour to his cousin , for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine 	2.515133976413553
only let me assure you , my dear miss elizabeth , that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage 	2.808130390004067
and he soon afterwards said aloud , " mr bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day ? " " i advise mr darcy , and lizzy , and kitty , " said mrs bennet , " to walk to oakham mount this morning 	3.373282821730656
on this subject , what can you have to say ? in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? " " you take an eager interest in that gentleman ' s concerns , " said darcy in a less tranquil tone , and with a heightened colour 	2.439399942280875
i beg you will not go 	4.103253087734291
that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham , before his arrival , but without gaining any satisfactory information 	3.1164309808688397
and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh , which i am certain he has very much at heart 	2.812599683319104
but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! the quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! but it was not to be 	3.4270091128531712
it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast 	2.6137821754617256
elizabeth could not help saying , " it is very much to his credit , i am sure , that you should think so 	3.799069840663868
she must own that she was tired of great houses 	3.869596243170502
with a book he was regardless of time 	4.13647962426324
human nature is so prone to fall into it ! no , lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame 	3.182669297917621
" there is also one other person in the party , " he continued after a pause , " who more particularly wishes to be known to you , will you allow me , or do i ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ? " the surprise of such an application was great indeed 	2.1816427953256032
and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt , than to run such a risk 	2.8073745362571954
you do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? " " blame you ! oh , no 	3.3482255490105164
" elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend 	2.7147512701679553
there was no arguing upon such a project 	3.0057920006323626
as a clergyman , moreover , i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence 	2.304147125658572
" " miss bingley told me , " said jane , " that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance 	2.9307669764493047
elizabeth was pleased , though , when she asked herself the reason , she had very little to say in reply 	2.9791546122028336
" hunsford , near westerham , kent , <num>th october 	2.910689882895978
" " how should you have liked making sermons ? " " exceedingly well 	2.8289071031997923
" " i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me 	2.4003895565638538
it mortifies me 	3.8976648816766932
elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits 	3.0100129207820947
here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country 	2.7887744541124553
the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man , the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley , and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening , till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity 	2.6386441699476864
she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage , and had a few minutes' conversation with charlotte , but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out 	2.7346926019958073
one i will not mention 	4.3765803208839404
let wickham be your man 	3.0552770438073504
and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away 	2.3976091513534388
you see on what a footing we are 	3.165169307725536
she examined into their employments , looked at their work , and advised them to do it differently 	2.9704086588502685
i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long 	2.992642241895069
his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention , the first to listen and to pity , the first to be admired 	2.3946141810120074
nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit 	2.931892716301744
on finding mrs bennet , elizabeth , and one of the younger girls together , soon after breakfast , he addressed the mother in these words , " may i hope , madam , for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth , when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? " before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise , mrs bennet instantly answered , " oh dear ! yes certainly 	2.7103034944249544
and be ready to believe , for every body ' s sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin 	2.5320100523565943
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth ' s performance , mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste 	2.4482129439058116
but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life 	2.2188293283059437
but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder 	3.5336660111025626
his plan did not vary on seeing them 	2.8201706274610308
these two girls had been above an hour in the place , happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner , watching the sentinel on guard , and dressing a sallad and cucumber 	2.1569759359904053
the whole party have left netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town 	2.8217254247186303
after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with " it is your turn to say something now , mr darcy 	2.7003135684768753
" " i have not a doubt of mr bingley ' s sincerity , " said elizabeth warmly 	3.2367712481058013
i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing 	2.8963658482716017
" elizabeth was distressed 	3.379203439926036
" of a fine , stout , healthy love it may 	3.3626791432677665
whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her , she could not tell , but he certainly had not seen her with composure 	2.8047195999519903
elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility 	3.1609575490177164
and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey , gave them directions as to the best method of packing , and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way , that maria thought herself obliged , on her return , to undo all the work of the morning , and pack her trunk afresh 	3.2704758913955
miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty 	2.489491087113463
she could think of nothing else , and yet whether bingley ' s regard had really died away , or were suppressed by his friends' interference 	2.5859206423334458
it was to this effect : " since writing the above , dearest lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature 	2.1465676243144345
" " shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine , what is to befall her ? " " i am more likely to want time than courage , elizabeth 	2.7629659145901764
you know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me 	2.703448402342146
mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said , " this walk is not wide enough for our party 	2.5206194391095362
" " and your assurance of it , i suppose , carried immediate conviction to him 	2.879293923579225
despite these efforts , project gutenberg tm electronic works , and the medium on which they may be stored , may contain " defects , " such as , but not limited to , incomplete , inaccurate or corrupt data , transcription errors , a copyright or other intellectual property infringement , a defective or damaged disk or other medium , a computer virus , or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment 	2.8884630061567504
but her commendation , though costing her some trouble , could by no means satisfy mr collins , and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship ' s praise into his own hands 	2.67021815784855
a report which highly incensed mrs bennet , and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood 	3.1249724847042217
with tears and lamentations of regret , invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham , and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage 	2.58661780194247
putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile , she said , " i did not know before that you ever walked this way 	3.0171098427015917
the tête à tête surprised them 	3.0232158318531597
and indeed , before we left bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country 	2.7444092241773044
and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you 	2.6181281928554423
but i am at his disposal 	3.1326094363215584
but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable , she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance 	3.3602898048831094
about ten or a dozen years ago , before her marriage , she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire , to which he belonged 	2.6019537449342836
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary 	2.3917441209225947
elizabeth could not but be pleased , could not but triumph 	3.3991963449744436
we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word 	3.37833704728502
if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least 	2.6518090120254927
the possibility of mr collins ' s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two 	2.681857932346018
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters , elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother , to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day 	2.6032061689981147
and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there 	2.667206242521881
" " that is not an unnatural surmise , " said fitzwilliam , " but it is lessening the honour of my cousin ' s triumph very sadly 	3.63310739606782
there he had talked to her friends , when he could not to herself 	3.3848599135814728
" " but , " she continued , recollecting herself , " as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him 	2.8179640287187135
her figure was elegant , and she walked well 	3.4923130562513527
my last letter had never reached her 	2.821742629435228
she is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all 	2.7351857265190067
" " but that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea 	3.6533935143745393
i shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point 	2.5424112048839693
" my dear brother , " at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , i hope will give you satisfaction 	2.4018838011486134
he was always to have gone on saturday , and to saturday he still meant to stay 	2.765808786258002
" " my object then , " replied darcy , " was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that i was not so mean as to resent the past 	2.9730794460230836
they came 	4.489837749533496
i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it 	3.012118515947475
" now , " said she , " that this first meeting is over , i feel perfectly easy 	3.058952940338901
they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister 	2.5756051213636297
" " no , " said colonel fitzwilliam , " that is an advantage which he must divide with me 	3.584779418124917
" " i dare say you believed it 	3.0929649998401594
and though feeling no reliance on her , could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved 	2.4979091137382863
never , even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield , or his dignified relations at rosings , had she seen him so desirous to please , so free from self consequence , or unbending reserve as now , when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours , and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed , would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings 	2.1074116293962817
what a contrast between him and his friend ! mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley , declined being introduced to any other lady , and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room , speaking occasionally to one of his own party 	2.5181628206212214
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good natured , gossiping lucases 	2.4526639043978
mrs bennet ' s eyes sparkled with pleasure , and she was eagerly calling out , while her daughter read , " well , jane , who is it from ? what is it about ? what does he say ? well , jane , make haste and tell us 	2.610953074775005
" " if he means to be but little at netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there 	2.390932366626853
" " thank you , sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me 	2.43549426460871
if the second copy is also defective , you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem 	2.217531805761824
" and pray may i ask ? " but checking himself , he added in a gayer tone , " is it in address that he improves ? has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? for i dare not hope , " he continued in a lower and more serious tone , " that he is improved in essentials 	2.5275101514981873
and , as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennet ' s carriage was to meet them , they quickly perceived , in token of the coachman ' s punctuality , both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs 	3.0100811611102407
the country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , mr bingley ? " " when i am in the country , " he replied , " i never wish to leave it 	3.5866483302648113
thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people ' s feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business 	2.6028949553974217
to the rest of the family they paid little attention 	3.13485285802137
that she is perfectly convinced of her brother ' s indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ! ) to put me on my guard ? can there be any other opinion on the subject ? " " yes , there can 	2.799235987269397
but good lord ! how unlucky ! there is not a bit of fish to be got to day 	2.3326109889439417
for while he was present , jane had no attention to bestow on any one else 	2.470657761891645
&c 	5.695003890444734
and soon afterwards mr darcy , drawing near elizabeth , said to her " do not you feel a great inclination , miss bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? " she smiled , but made no answer 	2.8669748556816073
it was all pride and insolence 	3.477594732632607
and mr darcy had much better finish his letter 	3.368468023401454
" i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? " said he , as he joined her 	3.0084504449570777
unless a copyright notice is included 	2.852106763126701
and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another , and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be 	2.558961706152031
but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon , he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance , that he considered the money as a mere trifle , and begged she would not make herself uneasy 	2.4869764929086076
we will settle with your father about the money afterwards 	2.5044490687312453
she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia ' s general behaviour , the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster , and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton , where the temptations must be greater than at home 	2.8269355467610477
it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy 	2.5593315109676955
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time 	3.128874618021683
poor dear child ! and now here ' s mr bennet gone away , and i know he will fight wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? the collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave 	2.3704517109970555
and when the carriage drove up to the door , the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces , and displayed itself over their whole bodies , in a variety of capers and frisks , was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome 	2.7315652432655084
but my dear lydia , i don't at all like your going such a way off 	2.4287153096638017
" elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement , but was too much oppressed to make any reply 	2.938596106938659
he had all the best part of beauty , a fine countenance , a good figure , and very pleasing address 	2.4309116825662906
chapter xviii 	2.740340420276896
" " true 	3.015247554755662
there was now employment for the whole party 	2.942111882556761
dear , dear lizzy 	4.528220242846953
" " and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself ? does he know his real character ? " " i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did 	2.4887286118732104
" " miss bennet , " replied her ladyship , in an angry tone , " you ought to know , that i am not to be trifled with 	4.109088374739215
" but depend upon it , mr collins , " she added , " that lizzy shall be brought to reason 	3.0688605917240945
but , lizzy ! oh , sister ! it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collins ' s wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness 	3.025673239210338
i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge 	2.9106157661040366
" charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful , and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time 	2.601479716170294
such a charming man ! so handsome ! so tall ! oh , my dear lizzy ! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before 	2.453138112435185
and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations 	2.5369522951490766
and mrs bennet , for many years after lydia ' s birth , had been certain that he would 	3.3383725171543
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow , and sat down again to her work , with an eagerness which it did not often command 	2.4187242143039263
and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much 	2.564782814618356
" elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment 	2.7683304715626043
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas ' s last week 	2.4614456524634196
there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us 	2.260397454530373
he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies , of whose beauty he had heard much 	2.6172714833844197
" two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge 	2.591885188283519
" " oh ! my dear , " cried his wife , " i cannot bear to hear that mentioned 	3.218132590874016
" " it is from miss bingley , " said jane , and then read it aloud 	3.7812592151788738
when tea was over , mr hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain 	2.4298315203526553
" it taught me to hope , " said he , " as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before 	2.8476792803509516
your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as i said before , they had a great deal of talk together 	3.388184092503857
it is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it 	3.3804594649980024
he has heartily forgiven me now 	3.0096885317174955
they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends , and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family , when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window , and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle , driving up the street 	2.535783436008521
she still expected that it would all end well , and that every morning would bring some letter , either from lydia or her father , to explain their proceedings , and perhaps announce the marriage 	2.8520799214891395
both sisters were uncomfortable enough 	3.175350459912274
and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , 'bingley , you had better stay till next week ,' you would probably do it , you would probably not go and , at another word , might stay a month 	2.5100470593064226
elizabeth would wonder , and probably would blame her 	2.6550198912915866
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight , and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister 	2.3325157376174315
on his quitting the room , she sat down , unable to support herself , and looking so miserably ill , that it was impossible for darcy to leave her , or to refrain from saying , in a tone of gentleness and commiseration , " let me call your maid 	2.974091263971828
" " you may depend upon my not mentioning it 	2.4692958927980366
" but of this answer lydia heard not a word 	2.6669229470340254
" i must go instantly to my mother 	3.007139794852228
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy 	2.4420867421375796
the only pain was in leaving her father , who would certainly miss her , and who , when it came to the point , so little liked her going , that he told her to write to him , and almost promised to answer her letter 	2.8749070235237593
" mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while mrs bennet was stirring the fire 	2.7409373082780655
vain indeed must be all her attentions , vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself , if he were already self destined to another 	2.4133916257356733
as he quitted the room , elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire 	2.325307744989907
" " i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party 	2.483985223058675
i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that 	2.2755843357664025
and as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject 	2.8411353736722487
i have not been used to submit to any person ' s whims 	3.1012311980785805
" oh ! dear , yes 	3.2500543402898043
they were confined for the evening at different tables , and she had nothing to hope , but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room , as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself 	3.3475996394711425
" " why will you think so ? it must be his own doing 	2.8891785486022497
mrs reynolds informed them , that it had been taken in his father ' s life time 	3.1635413742385765
and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible 	3.2038462516619934
and the hursts have no horses to theirs 	3.0414614365065393
" " not so hasty , if you please 	3.1559748258701963
" and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy , whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched , and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident 	2.501979172182514
she only smiles , i laugh 	3.0254746980324736
she looked at her father to entreat his interference , lest mary should be singing all night 	2.2987433176844823
but enough of this 	3.5882764673818794
) " well , so much the better 	3.3105182030002633
in the first place , she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter 	4.016251147196737
i am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but i hardly know what i have written 	3.8581391663858438
my dearest lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy , to be treating his father ' s favourite in such a manner , one , whom his father had promised to provide for 	2.83715530301966
a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant 	2.375000127483963
and mrs bennet found , with amazement and horror , that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter 	2.468006558482677
" " i did not think you would 	3.1758584657595956
jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency , a glow of such happy expression , as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening 	2.228069003692411
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned , and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself 	2.347470446552837
lady catherine ' s great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of 	2.9334927308607974
and , of course , i could not rest till i knew the particulars 	2.8166047706850543
and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who , by bringing her into derbyshire , had been the means of uniting them 	2.7135477614132206
perhaps there was some truth in this 	3.1171739922735227
and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia ' s flight , on her own folly alone 	2.5926791000433163
he introduced us to his sister 	3.075313918523027
you have sense , and we all expect you to use it 	2.8435531631188673
nothing could be more delightful ! to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love 	2.346497616533577
the next morning , as she was going down stairs , she was met by her father , who came out of his library with a letter in his hand 	3.105959178063171
the more i see of the world , the more am i dissatisfied with it 	2.6199093077384834
lady catherine was a tall , large woman , with strongly marked features , which might once have been handsome 	2.182745047132126
it was all conjecture 	3.65575237015819
" " and quite alone ? have all her friends left her ? " " mrs annesley is with her 	2.4537209492934244
i am very glad you liked her 	2.923822229212562
mrs bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydia ' s interruption , and promised that it should not occur again , if he would resume his book 	2.707504401038607
elizabeth longed to explore its windings 	3.4404657425921545
by many significant looks and silent entreaties , did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance , but in vain 	2.1882275850428576
she assured him that no one intended to play , and the silence of the whole party on the subject , seemed to justify her 	3.1024648772092593
but i will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks 	2.496812366840728
for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming 	2.872242100700755
but , really , i know not what to say 	3.3715495365661723
mrs collins knew not what to make of him 	2.902626177165933
both changed colour , one looked white , the other red 	2.5075840071973285
the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter 	2.6474820543205286
and that one thousand pounds in the <num> per cents 	2.536537816440313
to send donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <url> while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate 	1.8328070705400128
and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner 	2.273029137644274
and in spite of her youth and her manners , she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her 	2.731103424963027
this is not quite enough to make her understand his character 	3.2214173683885154
but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing , that instead of twelve , he had brought only six with him from london , his five sisters and a cousin 	2.606886609090734
i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you 	3.5127569962035308
and mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges , to make them his parting obeisance , was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence , of their appearing in very good health , and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected , after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings 	2.3901037184848177
came on into hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in barnet and hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through 	3.9000546454428173
but intricate characters are the most amusing 	2.8752498668416866
" mr wickham ' s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom , which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family 	2.4287617565510646

" " we will be down as soon as we can , " said jane 	3.3331411059347533
" this was spoken jestingly , but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy , that she would not trust herself with an answer 	3.245228579917142
but he never distinguished her by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites 	2.1574746919371437
mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet : one communication would , therefore , do for all 	2.5847192723525687
there is nothing he would not do for her 	3.3052449131601556
he actually danced with her twice 	2.793093956147689
in short , i will do my best 	3.622964543455194
and she seized the opportunity of saying , " is your sister at pemberley still ? " " yes , she will remain there till christmas 	3.2879841880594265
he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me 	2.425286534990128
there is nothing else to be done 	3.3696490358994233
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned 	2.3949810118474875
it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat , and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour 	2.5863130950840816
and you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner 	2.419222002121798
and she turned away with alarm , while mrs reynolds replied , that he was , adding , " but we expect him to morrow , with a large party of friends 	2.90224850542317
" " depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , i will visit them all 	3.0521869321902475
i shall be back by dinner 	3.20882380958746
and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife 	2.9788059833913603
after pausing on this point a considerable while , she once more continued to read 	2.555179226479387
" " indeed i do not dare 	3.629093755751555
we were always good friends 	3.2529529477555634
" " upon my word , sir , " cried elizabeth , " your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration 	2.6919691247370126
the miss webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your ' s 	2.460001976663706
i am sure i do not know 	3.5468428020168687
i have not forgot , you see 	3.235598671192304
our poor mother is sadly grieved 	3.2435164801715044
" " is he married or single ? " " oh ! single , my dear , to be sure ! a single man of large fortune 	2.833583493715664
his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped , and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment , maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance , and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth , requiring no partner in his pleasure 	2.446721791099798
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both 	2.4325352548202304
mrs bennet wondered at their coming , and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble , and was sure jane would have caught cold again 	2.297184039875183
he carved , and ate , and praised with delighted alacrity 	4.191023608783569
when this was done , she had a less active part to play 	3.0907291764848237
" i hope , " said she , as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day , " you will give your mother in law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue 	2.9707106771130527
miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay , for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other 	2.4308737076744924
we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money 	2.8651927956832997
the door was then allowed to be shut , and the carriage drove off 	3.1906957372188867
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him 	2.5705640191271213
and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it 	2.6191989334730303
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley , and that she could not speak a word , especially to miss darcy , without calling her attention 	3.2080653936779564
when they parted , lady catherine , with great condescension , wished them a good journey , and invited them to come to hunsford again next year 	2.551851673503072
" elizabeth , who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy , was in such misery of shame , that she could hardly keep her seat 	3.341390866482273
we are not rich enough , or grand enough for them 	3.035444348188097
and in the mean time , she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married , to mrs hill and the two housemaids 	2.2139245232525853
i see the imprudence of it 	3.1161061474968372
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished 	3.3038402103877873
for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast , and there he would continue , nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection , but really talking to mr bennet , with little cessation , of his house and garden at hunsford 	2.976865587089374
it was possible , however , that some of his companions in the shire , might be able to give more information 	3.1135550098951446
" it will then be early enough for expectation 	2.777479799666795
she read , with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension , and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring , was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes 	2.4813842103123838
she had been watching him the last hour , she said , as he walked up and down the street , and had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation , but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers , who in comparison with the stranger , were become " stupid , disagreeable fellows 	2.3961635708173965
" " my dear lizzy , you cannot think me so weak , as to be in danger now 	3.2107248844540814
but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected 	2.3873617709338992
it will not do 	4.599119476012326
her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman , and he was thinking of her with some complacency , when thus accosted by miss bingley , " i can guess the subject of your reverie 	3.0624747623315276
" did it , " said he , " did it soon make you think better of me ? did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? " she explained what its effect on her had been , and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed 	2.40728756796197
but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side , i hope it will not be long before they are 	2.8337317454281
he has also brotherly pride , which with some brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister 	2.509617895753228
his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost 	2.7164928122860084
the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd 	2.293866204416202
" " would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? " " upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter , darcy must speak for himself 	2.5615752815630706
" but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , " replied her uncle 	3.457916570865208
she liked him too little to care for his approbation 	2.6324916340825526
chapter ii 	3.5528427098738913
" he is as fine a fellow , " said mr bennet , as soon as they were out of the house , " as ever i saw 	3.2978903795531314
but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it 	2.4334830431196273
i had not an idea of it 	3.5090893287775815
many stared 	4.590660398678213
and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him , as now , when all love must be vain 	2.724119943832956
it was not till the afternoon , when he joined them at tea , that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject 	3.010079908021455
she felt that she had no business at pemberley , and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it 	3.5038367330215987
" " but he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather ' s death made her mistress of this fortune 	2.474090548286335
" from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been over rated , elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiner ' s long letter , but now , having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome , she was almost ashamed to find , that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness , and immediately wrote as follows : " i would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as i ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars 	2.501156476763407
and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that i can get no rest by night nor by day 	2.809806050275265
and then we were so merry all the way home ! we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! " to this , mary very gravely replied , " far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures 	2.4473912565855285
" then addressing her daughter , " oh ! my dear , dear jane , i am so happy ! i am sure i sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night 	3.229345395109648
" yes , always , " she replied , without knowing what she said , for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject , as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming , " i remember hearing you once say , mr darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable 	2.9046289897015924
but , lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it 	2.8261984005861316
" " it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , " said bingley 	3.2201445071721486
but i shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister ' s countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched 	2.9320202408367226
" elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude , but said nothing 	2.6881835237043585
i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure 	2.8895824601386426
his formal civility was just what it had been , and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family 	2.4787507315214143
for mary , on receiving amongst the thanks of the table , the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again , after the pause of half a minute began another 	2.3128599088963684
i never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong 	2.3762494525963738

chapter i 	3.5825234165940225
" elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme 	2.93754607730923
in the absence of jane , he always attached himself to elizabeth , for the pleasure of talking of her 	3.309055141413847
but i thought i might as well buy it as not 	2.6710163772165907
" it is nothing in comparison of rosings , my lady , i dare say 	2.7740880495449884
i need not explain myself farther 	2.961932677218373
now what have you to say ? " " only this 	3.4648544116564075
which will not be yours till after your mother ' s decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to 	2.683003378268923
it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune , and however uncertain of giving happiness , must be their pleasantest preservative from want 	2.330591887367845
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with , " i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy 	3.5171098710527593
secondly , she was very sure that mr collins had been taken in 	3.764387339886439
but he soon afterwards said , " i was surprised to see darcy in town last month 	3.024297631512015
any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year 	2.3755567165781923
but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal , that her mother , though often disheartened , had never yet despaired of succeeding at last 	3.5105274991570785
it pains me to offend you 	3.768341453051155

" elizabeth could not but look surprised 	2.9096774096586
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day , in such dirty weather , and by herself , was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley 	2.457458082349079
" lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer 	2.26857389110747
" how can you be so silly , " cried her mother , " as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! you will not be fit to be seen when you get there 	3.159744879310303
compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort , much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements 	2.16522515568758
he wrote me a few lines on wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which i particularly begged him to do 	3.247656879001803
darcy took up a book 	3.218521075621252
elizabeth , however astonished , was at least more prepared for an interview than before , and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness , if he really intended to meet them 	2.274311535983157
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors , and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife , was exactly what he had wished for 	2.492684678318886
but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth , by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial , to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy ' s opinion , and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities , by which some part of her family were connected with that corps 	2.8670950314423993

but tell me , what did you come down to netherfield for ? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequence ? " " my real purpose was to see you , and to judge , if i could , whether i might ever hope to make you love me 	2.363725166802213
" " and what is your success ? " she shook her head 	2.7424304469221155
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane , she was tempted , by the pleasantness of the morning , to stop at the gates and look into the park 	3.191176496214277

and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary 	2.698853966467236

" if i should ever go to brighton , i would behave better than lydia 	3.1420678905905195
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own 	3.0062525979694796
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs philips ' s manners and politeness 	2.4377661784069313
she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger , and wondered it had escaped her before 	2.7838617941914925
mr darcy , only for a few minutes to take leave , but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour , hoping for her return , and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found 	2.577157459152901
i told you so from the first , you may remember 	3.3406845286369347
her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming 	3.333158705288706
i was only confused for the moment , because i felt that i should be looked at 	3.076018008674476
do not distress me by the idea 	3.0574128053200016
" what , is he coming home , and without poor lydia ! " she cried 	2.8715940292659536
this was exactly as it should be 	3.536040929398426
" elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother , but remained quietly in the hall , till she and kitty were out of sight , then returned into the drawing room 	2.4156403370578348
" mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply 	2.622567725126665
the idea soon reached to conviction , as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself , and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity 	2.279978358303565
" " oh ! certainly , " cried his faithful assistant , " no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with 	2.3896165776546243
she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest , by talking of their supposed marriage , and planning his happiness in such an alliance 	2.4361115795833523
mr bennet ' s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year , which , unfortunately for his daughters , was entailed in default of heirs male , on a distant relation 	2.9875307844149166
it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong 	3.3826712060706523
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine , frankly and openly 	2.5865061071225397
it was more than civil 	3.4215964984791833
it is natural that obligation should be felt , and if i could feel gratitude , i would now thank you 	2.6765659693336286
where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making , and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself , some shelves in the closets up stairs 	3.435732210984728
and her expectations of advantage to her family , when in a happy humour , were so far beyond reason , that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day , to make his proposals 	2.513440446130601
i do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , jane one does not often see any body better looking 	2.5941830171855336
this , she would not hear of 	4.7950585901743406
the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic 	2.6497098405835873
my reasons for believing it are briefly these : it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable 	2.060641994257013
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude 	2.201121302759468
he had a pleasant countenance , and easy , unaffected manners 	2.8782980627074464
but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood , and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess 	2.678513159051943
and what with the philipses , the lucases , and the officers , there was not a day without its engagement 	4.173147979102026
the principal purport of his letter was to inform them , that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia 	3.3364971905546565
his countenance rather gained in austerity 	2.952162624155944
" " she seems a very pleasant young woman , " said bingley 	2.965370315649718
such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret 	2.895630507529343
at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them , meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room 	2.5137223486545155
and lydia led voluntarily to subjects , which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world 	2.425602638241215
you shall not defend her , though it is charlotte lucas 	3.13803663787548

i will speak to her about it myself directly 	2.8496804881287603
with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power 	2.55768892839873
to miss lydia bennet ,' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing 	2.619644720420476
" " the country , " said darcy , " can in general supply but few subjects for such a study 	2.8624039866042743
mr darcy is engaged to my _ 	3.23943581043781
for at any rate , there seemed a gulf impassable between them 	3.0713696795404073
but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening 	2.1810262606613446
and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second 	2.692205058054444
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention 	2.540286661749136
and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love , and the object of that love , her friend eliza , she sat herself seriously to work to find it out 	2.6139813023005307
neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends , that could materially lessen its weight 	2.3247440166440683
we had better go into the avenue 	3.1221128340945437
all was joy and kindness 	3.1132856139884595
" she replied in the affirmative 	3.5851922878682294
" and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ! oh , that i knew how it was ! " but wishes were vain 	2.7232166681393566
darcy , on the contrary , had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion , for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest , and from none received either attention or pleasure 	2.208127243597357
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs , i cannot tell 	2.3407077280119832
where shall you change horses ? oh ! bromley , of course 	2.9881454412253063
" but it is , " returned she 	3.50971058339739
she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia , in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man , who , on meeting him accidentally in town , had there renewed a slight acquaintance 	2.509377963380992
with a triumphant smile , they were told , that it was ten miles round 	3.628268859896117
for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health , and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight 	2.963934319240643
her astonishment , as she reflected on what had passed , was increased by every review of it 	2.7073766346627584
the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him 	2.5714505310098263
and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself 	3.0314620433620116
i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me 	3.0209628566785716

since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with wickham , he easily learnt , had never been his design 	2.628001463054201
" what a letter is this , to be written at such a moment 	3.2437859201203345
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly 	2.542499456659417
sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton , where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king , during his mayoralty 	2.628101793680097
but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love 	2.5298930750090385
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes 	2.8827373823441347

with your good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! affectation of candour is common enough 	2.401746102082532
lydia was exceedingly fond of him 	2.961540634578641
and i never saw such happy manners ! so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! " " he is also handsome , " replied elizabeth , " which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can 	2.8983603871393075

" mr bennet ' s expectations were fully answered 	2.962937639562023
" that is rather singular 	3.7855068995885737
you have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer 	2.8687536505746025
i was sometimes quite provoked , but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane , and for their sakes had patience with her 	2.979407104862481
it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town 	2.4928017378498235
" " i cannot believe it 	2.9526522999100835
the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough 	2.629654123444961
she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards 	2.555170198437695
pride he probably had , and if not , it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town , where the family did not visit 	2.3783200917589804
and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them , threw a real gloom over their domestic circle 	2.8905351027185455
she was not the better pleased with his gallantry , from the idea it suggested of something more 	2.596471979707223
" " good gracious ! mr darcy ! and so it does i vow 	2.7666916719364334

we all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man 	3.0951703056222484
till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled , a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her 	2.434447561494935
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse , and that she could not leave her 	3.4115425952617073
many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan 	2.397923710182077
" elizabeth ' s misery increased , at such unnecessary , such officious attention ! were the same fair prospect to arise at present , as had flattered them a year ago , every thing , she was persuaded , would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion 	2.545295421105006

wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison 	2.6183573297676106
" " her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town 	2.33043647897145
any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings 	2.730530458138995
and mr bingley ' s large fortune , the mention of which gave animation to their mother , was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign 	2.6394366359254176
and sir william , to elizabeth ' s high diversion , was stationed in the doorway , in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him , and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way 	3.0613037645965924
" but what , " said she , after a pause , " can have been his motive ? what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? " " a thorough , determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy 	2.496978243350122

lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her 	2.7250701500904064
he spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided 	2.9013752613983823
but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , i suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman 	2.9907858774563936
ring the bell , kitty , for hill 	3.0445556626516135
if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room , i shall be very thankful 	2.9949076551686873
it was at sir william lucas ' s , where a large party were assembled 	3.214425966666694
and i wish with all my heart it may prove so 	2.485323860779787
it appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel ' s family , that i am strongly inclined to hope the best 	2.543006913320748
and wickham , who happened to sit near elizabeth , began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood , with a good humoured ease , which she felt very unable to equal in her replies 	2.3981662618314723
but , lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or jane at most 	2.4565190756664723
you may have drawn him in 	3.2488423231183026
" he is now gone into the army , " she added , " but i am afraid he has turned out very wild 	2.8534061262627857
and , for a few moments , she flattered herself that her wishes did not err 	2.630450497506441
on the gentlemen ' s appearing , her colour increased 	2.5653649896101753
" " do let us have a little music , " cried miss bingley , tired of a conversation in which she had no share 	3.531666824467889
" mr bennet made no answer 	2.6199784084011726
darcy , after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did , a question which she could not answer without confusion , said scarcely any thing 	2.5695110009802704
but , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art 	4.023055246473469
she will follow wherever lydia leads 	2.774010083145975
when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas , and was in conversation with her , when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy , who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand , that , without knowing what she did , she accepted him 	2.787085127423507
no , no , let me shift for myself 	3.4787495595821945
miss darcy and her brother appeared , and this formidable introduction took place 	2.569800367451305
blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing 	2.2233585320406797
jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london 	2.5448939951614187
she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet , and was a great comfort to them , in their hours of freedom 	3.1392589214276536
and she would have wondered why , without violently caring for her , he chose to elope with her at all , had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances 	2.5905255450570808
when he was gone , they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on , and their uncle promised , at parting , to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn , as soon as he could , to the great consolation of his sister , who considered it as the only security for her husband ' s not being killed in a duel 	2.8107094354622886
but i know the foundation is unjust 	2.968707954642767
" " yes , " replied wickham 	3.118232971835193
" " we will go as far as meryton with you , " said catherine and lydia 	3.242200786250526
and the girls had the pleasure of hearing , as they entered the drawing room , that mr wickham had accepted their uncle ' s invitation , and was then in the house 	3.1872701512673753
but i am an idle fellow , and though i have not many , i have more than i ever look into 	3.2296667878602676
and fourthly , that the match might be broken off 	4.034137128202744
" " let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility 	2.510862537208043
she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine ' s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte ' s observation , and hurried her away to her room 	2.3761148918549106
she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself , in their first evening at mr philips ' s 	2.399497732271503
her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous 	2.4937534143666276
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident 	2.751983357295759
mrs bennet , to whose apartment they all repaired , after a few minutes conversation together , received them exactly as might be expected 	2.507254296049897
mr bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy 	2.459733158479703
kitty , to her very material advantage , spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters 	2.637146696929516
mr philips visited them all , and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before 	2.3520062176911893
but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? " elizabeth excused herself as well as she could 	3.0045032615785012
take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one 	3.598632286513133
and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night , she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon 	2.5053593407107457
stop me whilst you can 	3.1596088768325385
but mrs bennet , who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished , was excessively disappointed 	2.495980387777626
but not handsome enough to tempt me 	2.991410895829086
but it pleased her 	3.410301041264331
" then , who taught you ? who attended to you ? without a governess you must have been neglected 	2.647854125133775
" you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing 	2.8881158444816957
or at least , by the predominance of virtue , atone for those casual errors , under which she would endeavour to class , what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance 	3.097787127741667
" then shewing her purchases : " look here , i have bought this bonnet 	2.6197129689178995
allowing for the common demands of the game , mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth , and she was very willing to hear him , though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told , the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy 	2.958555271728498
chapter iv 	4.2330549088346086
" with a stronger voice she soon added , " i have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself 	2.8631713183508793
" mr darcy , who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face , seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise 	2.643165559927457
he kissed it with affectionate gallantry , though he hardly knew how to look , and they entered the house 	2.969100698159579
if i have wounded your sister ' s feelings , it was unknowingly done 	3.8582166565449176
miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it 	2.7260228772523223
perhaps he thought her too young 	3.1481022817935576
she went on 	4.402172581315464
but of the truth of what i shall relate , i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity 	2.947634240029628
nor could she think , without a smile , of what her ladyship ' s indignation would have been 	3.1504455006532517
" i know not , miss elizabeth , " said he , " whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it 	2.790089555323678
what did colonel forster say ? had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ? they must have seen them together for ever 	2.31504608563121
not a syllable was uttered by either 	2.654645324263157
had she found jane in any apparent danger , mrs bennet would have been very miserable 	2.9259396583399564
it was generally evident whenever they met , that he did admire her 	2.977550963430665
nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister 	2.5312712216804356
" " yes , she did 	3.517295949052523
this mrs younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with wickham 	2.768005261184905
" " why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks 	2.6294113629054023
it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement 	1.8573662660159327
towards him i have been kinder than towards myself 	3.709044227320883
i can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , i have seen nothing of it 	2.475986175611542
" but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into , was shortly relieved , and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope , by an article of news , which then began to be in circulation 	2.384540843844083
she talked to elizabeth again and again 	3.328102629745001
" " ten thousand pounds ! heaven forbid ! how is half such a sum to be repaid ? " mr bennet made no answer , and each of them , deep in thought , continued silent till they reached the house 	2.5116062917159416
" i am astonished , " said miss bingley , " that my father should have left so small a collection of books 	2.9575477441409093
but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted , or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ? all that i can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry 	2.4040030057791855
pursuing her way along the lane , she then began it 	2.6441111253315515
and mr collins , being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader , was extremely well pleased to close his large book , and go 	2.217207021685549
" " but my father cannot 	3.072680520522182
and if she accepted any refreshment , seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs collins ' s joints of meat were too large for her family 	2.5258814025207728
how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd ! yet it did , and even a third 	2.4977645373233273
" " a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe 	2.24576261991199
she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight , and was certain of a willing listener in jane , whenever she might wish to talk again of either 	2.6302770414643666
but the shortness of her stay , and yet more , the alteration of her manner , would allow jane to deceive herself no longer 	2.6834623306560457
" " at four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace making gentleman , " said mr bennet , as he folded up the letter 	3.0508499268521065
elizabeth ' s spirits soon rising to playfulness again , she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her 	2.4815041945364644
eager to be alone , and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt , she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley , and then hurried away to dress 	2.4643112938142955
she had never perceived , while the regiment was in hertfordshire , that lydia had any partiality for him , but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body 	2.5739055695001385
at length , she spoke again 	3.332124224485278
the note was immediately dispatched , and its contents as quickly complied with 	2.1852802928646935
but his father ' s uncommon attachment to me , irritated him i believe very early in life 	2.874785347665701
they then sat down , and when her enquiries after rosings were made , seemed in danger of sinking into total silence 	2.3336307739738955
mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty 	3.202626419254793
as for wickham and lydia , their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters 	3.02996298701055
yes , there was something in that 	3.9971558980617794
i was right , therefore 	3.2891390663303377
" " it ought to be so 	3.213179436019494
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt , or his dependence on her judgment , but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do 	2.6134163658400746
her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself , that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking , which ceased when he saw her no more 	2.7829699866155106
chapter xvi 	3.554720655478363
the others then joined her , and expressed their admiration of his figure 	2.89424492213692
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her , and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening 	2.8817075284495917
the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time , and the plan became perfect as plan could be 	2.6394247985805213
jane heard them with horror 	3.2121783133747295
" you certainly do , " she replied with a smile 	3.4207593443975726
<num>	4.24676143746824
" my dear niece , " i have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you 	2.7922358290660183
jane will be quite an old maid soon , i declare 	2.676445126970408
but at the same time , there was no one , whose knowledge of a sister ' s frailty would have mortified her so much 	3.125182302554427
lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets , of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won , and mr collins , in describing the civility of mr and mrs philips , protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist , enumerating all the dishes at supper , and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins , had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house 	2.5433371792469983
" " i will not trust myself on the subject , " replied wickham , " i can hardly be just to him 	3.504988523319444
" my dear eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way 	3.144358760686876
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection , elizabeth ' s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty 	2.3478791455955887
london : printed for t 	2.3855035427292264
the room in which the ladies sat was backwards 	3.008142369715585
and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers 	2.455591180496992
mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family 	2.581513139819924
but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body , hardly excepting even her sister , and could not like them 	2.6305585578545103
i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me 	2.1997976974388758
for mrs bennet , with more perseverance than politeness , protested he must be entirely mistaken , and lydia , always unguarded and often uncivil , boisterously exclaimed , " good lord ! sir william , how can you tell such a story ? do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy ? " nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment 	2.3217638542471835
but this idea was soon banished , and her spirits were very differently affected , when , to her utter amazement , she saw mr darcy walk into the room 	2.7012121449179785
" she held out her hand 	2.9625772498385285
no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph 	3.372630910248336
multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets ( example : m^{rs} )	3.0860515579122914
" " oh ! shocking ! " cried miss bingley 	2.8432728065006243
his behaviour to myself has been scandalous 	2.9939133956805115
he added , that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present , to leave london , and promised to write again very soon 	3.094882287411813
" elizabeth asked questions in vain 	2.7167327505814285
i saw them the night before last 	2.8313144847843104
she really looked almost wild 	3.0394385256459833
for though the chief of his concerns , with the son of his patron , were imperfectly understood , it was yet a well known fact that , on his quitting derbyshire , he had left many debts behind him , which mr darcy afterwards discharged 	2.566806409663872
but that it was no worse , she had need to be thankful 	3.4377965549391916
" perhaps she meant well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one cannot see too little of one ' s neighbours 	2.4439340633441278
" she is so fond of mrs forster , " said she , " it will be quite shocking to send her away ! and there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much 	2.8425204837776663
you shall hear what she says 	3.1774368617280575
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed , the unacknowledged were silent 	3.0838453609194736
" " and till colonel forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , i suppose , of their being really married ? " " how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ! i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister ' s happiness with him in marriage , because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right 	2.5942673556438094
he has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing 	2.59305987772975
but pride where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation 	2.597944991892238
she then yawned again , threw aside her book , and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement 	2.867078471852015
there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended 	2.6643965632897473
the rector of a parish has much to do 	2.591536827470341
i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters 	2.8256809081183265
no wonder if they love her better 	2.7391929742966976
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity 	3.0497773409013273
she really rejoiced at it 	3.116732841867925
lady catherine listened to half a song , and then talked , as before , to her other nephew 	2.574484451507601
and when at last kitty did , she very innocently said , " what is the matter mamma ? what do you keep winking at me for ? what am i to do ? " " nothing child , nothing 	2.5319442021677894
" she then sought her eldest sister , who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley 	2.9655218124699543
though we can never be what we once were to each other 	2.7898422138379453
the ladies drove on , and the others returned into the house 	3.641328939455814
" and may i ask ? " said elizabeth , " but the terms , i suppose , must be complied with 	3.215398556119698
to the civil enquiries which then poured in , and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingley ' s , she could not make a very favourable answer 	3.0782894598667374
but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane 	3.0311961119324966
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is 	2.458317377897968
" for mrs long has just been here , and she told me all about it 	2.8976195839668466
and her uncle and aunt , leaving her to enjoy them in quiet , set off by themselves 	2.4299515010116988
mrs bennet ' s schemes for this day were ineffectual 	2.7220748521710716
they now walked on in silence 	3.18834103623226
" " when they all removed to brighton , therefore , you had no reason , i suppose , to believe them fond of each other 	2.738620690289599
" mrs bennet , in short , was in very great spirits 	3.4847227106992986
she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied , from the reason of things , that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love , rather than by his 	2.5199596240362627
and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once 	2.466790478270805
you agree that the foundation , the trademark owner , and any distributor under this agreement will not be liable to you for actual , direct , indirect , consequential , punitive or incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such damage 	2.347233388421986
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday 	2.9744945569258805
and charlotte , detained first by the civility of mr collins , whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute , and then by a little curiosity , satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear 	2.334095726306565
his character sunk on every review of it 	2.4858214121648503
and returned no more , till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour 	2.558437586055936
first of all , he asked miss lucas 	3.3137222220786544
" it is a handsome face 	3.4667869237910054
it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before 	2.4935850590360773
mrs philips ' s vulgarity was another , and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance 	3.1354606961812572
if she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough 	3.258497162765577
say that urgent business calls us home immediately 	2.780611063548373
the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ! " she was now , on being settled at home , at leisure to observe the real state of her sister ' s spirits 	2.5237188529079564
and as she walked up and down the room , endeavouring to compose herself , saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt , as made every thing worse 	2.407976813545656
and who knows what may happen ? but that is nothing to us 	2.6777320458677423
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed 	2.1442257128759272
first , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion 	2.7232226050043113
and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton , of whom i shall subjoin a list , according to his information 	2.771993850260165
could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts ? she supposed , if he meant any thing , he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter 	2.329749881406522
we neither of us perform to strangers 	2.721583100963173
he repeated the question , with some surprise at her silence 	2.718944476399972
my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking 	2.7557020362812663
" " and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley 	2.981602790195723
" then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy , she left elizabeth to walk by herself 	2.5657211685878307
elizabeth went away with her head full of him 	2.674687162878443
" this is an evening of wonders , indeed ! and so , darcy did every thing 	2.79450751915784
" " i am sick of mr bingley , " cried his wife 	3.6831221514611334
and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life 	2.3259495466882827
his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity 	2.400478270755129
but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas ' s 	2.670483578716186
jane was not deceived , but she was affected 	3.357063373115439
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state 	2.836026379138015
but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? " " will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? " " by all means , " cried bingley 	2.4193400979500117
" with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew 	2.5227557768283972
she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place , and accordingly began by observing , that his arrival had been very unexpected " for your housekeeper , " she added , " informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow 	2.556892538359894
and , after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt , her resentment gave way , either to her affection for him , or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself 	2.79805977440534
and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town 	3.20063938349604
i am sure you will be very comfortable there 	3.761877407039039
but there was much to be talked of , in marrying her 	2.7809170404479104
" " indeed i could not 	3.628388513260315
he was a tall , heavy looking young man of five and twenty 	2.69896729023546
could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes 	2.654015508940714
the family were assembled in the breakfast room , to receive them 	3.1586045289233935
they will take care not to outrun their income 	3.281414346852936
his sister was less delicate , and directed her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile 	2.8120682188086197
that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother , and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling 	2.232687049363432
and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see 	2.52997314984542
it makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else 	2.7847107931891415
and not a day went by without a solitary walk , in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections 	2.390899876299435
painful recollections will intrude , which cannot , which ought not to be repelled 	3.235576620651443
between the two eldest and herself especially , there subsisted a very particular regard 	2.5412799682560454
make haste , my love 	3.302545206101136
but it ended in nothing , and i will not be sent on a fool ' s errand again 	3.8651507264622946
it was gratitude 	3.750709510044516
whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession 	3.0048576595228407
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared 	4.375537142741365
if you are a good girl for the next ten years , i will take you to a review at the end of them 	2.5769560785369667
lydia was occasionally a visitor there , when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath 	2.1944482675415435
" " and that is quite impossible 	2.9930914313117483
i know it all 	3.6935210725895327
how i long to see her ! and to see dear wickham too ! but the clothes , the wedding clothes ! i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly 	2.282166525940231
elizabeth saw what he was doing , and at the first convenient pause , turned to him with an arch smile , and said , " you mean to frighten me , mr darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well 	2.742724659933579
she was going to the butcher ' s , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed 	3.0296151552197417
for such an attachment as this , she might have sufficient charms 	3.272483704068843
" elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room 	2.5687920845000933
smiles decked the face of mrs bennet , as the carriage drove up to the door 	3.461403536709811
" what would she have said ? how would she have behaved ? " were questions with which she amused herself 	2.1340211054081215
while settling this point , she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell , and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself , who had once before called late in the evening , and might now come to enquire particularly after her 	2.7065605511027284
and before he went away , an engagement was formed , chiefly through his own and mrs bennet ' s means , for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband 	2.7615416248435705
i did not know before , that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony 	3.698390606011414
while in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ! do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh ? are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? " " yes , and i had heard it before 	2.4706794802620133
rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours , he had yielded to his brother in law ' s intreaty that he would return to his family , and leave it to him to do , whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit 	2.905150343222267
i am going away myself 	3.3395359208246242
" " the present always occupies you in such scenes does it ? " said he , with a look of doubt 	2.893885993471458
do not you , darcy ? " " my style of writing is very different from yours 	2.968057685300059
the officers may not be so pleasant in general 's regiment 	3.2608638932719796
he could not speak a word for full ten minutes 	2.9829665871067395
i feel as if i had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve 	2.3880529737647507
" " well , then , you need not be under any alarm 	2.7264657866151043
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns 	2.4128611275352974
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield 	2.6895989484770277
he heard her with astonishment 	3.113713248263106
but we are all liable to error 	2.989401728818393
elizabeth ' s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations 	2.7469733386199358
they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece , who , astonished and confused , scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face , and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family 	2.2646465882289757
every body is disgusted with his pride 	2.992603809782268
to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied , before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery 	2.630642844641786
as he said this , she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer 	3.249625596332021
elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over , and , though determined not to slacken as a correspondent , it was for the sake of what had been , rather than what was 	3.2591084678421507
no principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy 	3.32407206613651
" there is nothing the matter with me 	3.099510992235207
and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september , than any body else in the country 	3.2180030100048813
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions 	3.106517857907023
she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country 	2.811649201320394
till i have your disposition , your goodness , i never can have your happiness 	2.8593619939454884
" mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her , and said , " you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment 	2.981338146335379
" i am afraid , mr darcy , " observed miss bingley , in a half whisper , " that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes 	3.184874931610971
but gracious me ! i quite forgot ! i ought not to have said a word about it 	2.2087139256429897
or rather he has not wickham ' s countenance , for his features are perfectly good 	2.8781204234738635
" and so saying , he turned back with them , and walked towards the house 	3.030722843278533
and still thought there might have been time enough 	3.0424917414215558
" " is it possible ! " cried elizabeth , when she had finished 	3.486841597761298
the discussion of mr collins ' s offer was now nearly at an end , and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it , and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother 	2.6238452755181205
" but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome 	2.5800216450927462
that he had then no reserves , no scruples in sinking mr darcy ' s character , though he had assured her that respect for the father , would always prevent his exposing the son 	2.404992944737698
a father absent , a mother incapable of exertion , and requiring constant attendance 	2.260943994103534
proud that in a cause of compassion and honour , he had been able to get the better of himself 	2.9403604347344974
he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton 	2.618580898499262
" she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged 	2.409410650208234
" " no i cannot talk of books in a ball room 	2.29115629409298
i dare say the lace upon mrs hurst ' s gown " here she was interrupted again 	2.2420857084989856
and during part of that time , mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley , who came from the dance for a few minutes , to press his friend to join it 	2.7758953225546827
and after stating her imprudence , i am happy to add , that i owed the knowledge of it to herself 	2.919214794890335
to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed , and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation , console herself for the present , and prepare for another disappointment 	2.439939533238353
" the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days 	2.5324220552998327
elizabeth immediately recognising the livery , guessed what it meant , and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations , by acquainting them with the honour which she expected 	2.740006871321297
too good for the waiter , is not it ? there is no danger of wickham ' s marrying mary king 	2.770801159210858
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her 	2.23368790431837
" " this is not to be borne 	3.446236162930764
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject , and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect 	2.739983683560361
but they obligingly satisfied it , with the same kind of supposition , which had appeased mrs bennet ' s curiosity 	3.0881666364744143
i must beg to return to the house 	2.855770285816008
but i suppose you had no opportunity 	3.1730060460657277
if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity 	2.357321948754106
but amongst other causes of disquiet , she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour 	2.4821839986269274
and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet 	3.16675603942472
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley 	3.163819154182268
" and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well 	2.717702045792737
" " if i were as rich as mr darcy , " cried a young lucas who came with his sisters , " i should not care how proud i was 	2.9013778079781063
" " upon my word , caroline , i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation 	2.277691301172753
and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend 	2.165717860277514
" " but you see that jane , " said her aunt , " does not think so ill of wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt 	2.9102128479280256
the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge , and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed 	2.3456234181048776
they had not been long together , before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her 	2.615029290586045
far be it from me , " he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure , " to resent the behaviour of your daughter 	2.6779465867142376
we all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing 	3.0984298676307507
your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham 	2.223505645724428
he must write his own sermons 	2.9777646925350747
condolence , insufferable 	4.559422717712282
several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle , a private had been flogged , and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married 	3.012680907410559
" i am sure , " she added , " if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper i ever met with 	3.259805524413392
and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable 	2.4002840483379124
and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning 	2.9501974032111624
" mr collins , " said she , " speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter 	2.9247896653450116
she had high animal spirits , and a sort of natural self consequence , which the attentions of the officers , to whom her uncle ' s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her , had increased into assurance 	2.679687649896129
but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at 	2.5016495427346923
but , alas ! the ladies had crowded round the table , where miss bennet was making tea , and elizabeth pouring out the coffee , in so close a confederacy , that there was not a single vacancy near her , which would admit of a chair 	2.736524912588136
he has the promise of an ensigncy in general 's regiment , now quartered in the north 	2.78824938005975
did you see him while you were at lambton ? i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had 	2.387195705011893
she felt that jane ' s feelings , though fervent , were little displayed , and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner , not often united with great sensibility 	2.856740131905813
" " yes , indeed 	3.00119708500709
wickham passed all his youth there , you know 	2.66768217205545
they have a sharp , shrewish look , which i do not like at all 	4.54335811105999
<num>	4.24676143746824
he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem 	2.664304631829745
and perhaps he might be doing the same 	2.989592204797232
" i know very well , madam , " said he , " that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things , and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object 	2.4727940601847656
they were of a respectable family in the north of england 	2.4617777468073876
and as i come back , i can call on lady lucas and mrs long 	2.7695879424821395
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much , and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help 	2.533858645412535
he had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for , and i could not have forgotten my revered father ' s intentions 	2.880038955094991
she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball , and abruptly reminded him of his promise 	2.9559966732262453
he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility , which made her two daughters ashamed , especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend 	2.305641515599307
his complexion became pale with anger , and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature 	3.0159010052860786
soon after you left me on saturday , i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were 	2.5114858561353097
did not i mention it to you ? mr robinson ' s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and which he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question oh ! the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt , there cannot be two opinions on that point 	2.4471274021126064
for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me 	2.469606876194379
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen , they returned down stairs , and taking leave of the housekeeper , were consigned over to the gardener , who met them at the hall door 	2.7196036440201588
" " pardon me for interrupting you , madam , " cried mr collins 	3.1060101728468514
i thought i should have broke my heart 	2.9952520482999043
" with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes , did lydia , assisted by kitty ' s hints and additions , endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn 	2.5684230827337977
she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken 	3.358781496013713
my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better 	2.4506161696743503
bingley of course returned with him to dinner 	3.070213521130532
and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane , and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do 	2.863902933365858
i think i have heard you say that you know them 	3.10628958402125
she had been unwilling to mention bingley 	3.127376164018717
lydia ' s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten 	3.132720590083386
" he could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town 	2.8365615383758986
" " lady catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use 	3.1266784393859757
but mr gardiner could not be seen , and mr darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning 	2.9398020497995008
you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her 	2.810418811864214
and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown 	2.5927586406742935
it was only said , 'lately , george wickham , esq 	3.4825194266703883
and he afterwards took occasion to ask her , when unattended to by any of the rest , whether all her sisters were at longbourn 	2.5906858583104664
" this information made elizabeth smile , as she thought of poor miss bingley 	2.755019698289374
a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features , but he said not a word , and elizabeth , though blaming herself for her own weakness , could not go on 	3.2393043846376783
his pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by 	2.974423626660981
but he had something to direct his search , which was more than we had 	2.8400911559086994
" " there is , i believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome 	2.1932767422026935
for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom 	2.1852942911375908
" do you certainly leave kent on saturday ? " said she 	2.789813706393424
her sisters were uneasy for her , but her mother was delighted 	3.715644731934383
but as i have actually paid the visit , we cannot escape the acquaintance now 	2.4989394184664753
" " and so was i 	2.974164954986545
a resolution the more necessary to be made , but perhaps not the more easily kept , because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them , and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room 	2.4095252294478935
this was very amiable , but charlotte ' s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of 	2.783242363279818
i am so pleased so happy 	3.043084897853259
" " i hope not so 	3.15128277338095
they entered it in one of its lowest points , and drove for some time through a beautiful wood , stretching over a wide extent 	2.3043808912533432
nothing , on the contrary , could be more natural 	3.6320872136836893
he absolutely started , and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise 	2.914815763017049
mrs bennet , through the assistance of servants , contrived to have the earliest tidings of it , that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side , might be as long as it could 	3.018262491956362
that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately 	2.519226982490943
" repeated the other , as she ran into her room to prepare 	3.3994642168443017
" " whatever i do is done in a hurry , " replied he 	2.6233095361581182
and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance , so full of contradictions and varieties , sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance , and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination 	3.004740526814914
only think of that my dear 	3.7809421683914226
i was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him 	3.172753562537092
and , from a determination of making him speak , she continued , " i remember , when we first knew her in hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty 	2.9351299489969715
after abusing you so abominably to your face , i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations 	2.343595587077152
a carat character is used to denote superscription 	3.329723295629358
it was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that wickham ' s character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was 	2.876145367263366
what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? as a brother , a landlord , a master , she considered how many people ' s happiness were in his guardianship ! how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow ! how much of good or evil must be done by him ! every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character , and as she stood before the canvas , on which he was represented , and fixed his eyes upon herself , she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before 	2.4190631468227544
and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then 	3.1797057733461194
her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical 	3.182158827320822
and all that i can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself 	3.231979786636448
" oh , yes ! he was to come there with wickham , you know 	3.145885809854764
he made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him 	3.1921632232226433
it was first broken by mrs annesley , a genteel , agreeable looking woman , whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse , proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others 	1.9706948454039968
on opening the door , she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth , as if engaged in earnest conversation 	2.9336355926401843
you may remember what i told you on that point , when first we talked of it 	2.478786565382301
oxford , blenheim , warwick , kenelworth , birmingham , &c 	4.24922477616259

" she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue , while in town , for the recovery of his daughter 	2.6271985936431146
" if i , " said mr collins , " were so fortunate as to be able to sing , i should have great pleasure , i am sure , in obliging the company with an air 	3.253884612014584
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my manner has been at all reprehensible , i here beg leave to apologise 	2.514218238644312
and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification 	2.9313170623326545
or at least it was impossible not to try for information 	2.9171005229214937
i always had a value for him 	2.9689363661543187
and every dish was commended , first by him , and then by sir william , who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said , in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear 	2.6709706070978654
she does not yet leave her dressing room 	3.1472888874161553

" " lizzy , when you first read that letter , i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now 	2.7951087169527025
in truth i must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings 	2.7081477281274227
and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy 	2.650218371012507
because we shall see the less of him 	2.849383715230923
" you doubt me , " cried jane , slightly colouring 	3.067588872057268
not all that mrs bennet , however , with the assistance of her five daughters , could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley 	3.0112980610478672
and if that were the case , he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion 	3.2280234459544643
they followed her into the dining parlour 	3.3565259185105396
but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising 	2.8207736047534686
charlotte did not stay much longer , and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard 	2.7898248077411756
and mrs collins ' s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much 	2.5198291214360324
he had lost every point 	3.469709212901985
miss bennet ' s lovely face confirmed his views , and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority 	2.281447490997508
he , who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection , she now saw the object of open pleasantry 	2.357807543657967
a scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful 	2.6006215287974834
and as that left too short a period for them to go so far , and see so much as they had proposed , or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on , they were obliged to give up the lakes , and substitute a more contracted tour 	2.480819743085035

mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend , that had attended her from that part of the world 	2.5708249945599913
wickham will soon be gone 	3.532923298576184
" " to be sure , lizzy , " said her aunt , " he is not so handsome as wickham 	4.049575057243835

what will you think of my vanity ? i believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses 	2.419750842314936
but , though she always kept a very good table , she did not think any thing less than two courses , could be good enough for a man , on whom she had such anxious designs , or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year 	2.4889725910637432

how you must have hated me after that evening ? " " hate you ! i was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction 	2.5649186758480376

he is a most interesting young man 	3.3849751500720933
and whenever they changed their quarters , either jane or herself were sure of being applied to , for some little assistance towards discharging their bills 	2.2278640718528635
sir william did not say much 	3.198041128918765
you need not send them word at longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when i write to them , and sign my name lydia wickham 	2.7713733129925724
and however bare of news the country in general might be , they always contrived to learn some from their aunt 	2.270389320436489
" he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress , wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope , and leaving his compliments for her relations , with only one serious , parting , look , went away 	1.9112337053292656

he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it 	2.5675687397494644
" she then read the first sentence aloud , which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly , and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street , where mr hurst had a house 	2.197838543131243
" " i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression 	2.1949193896033616
" this fine account of him , " whispered her aunt , as they walked , " is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend 	3.35358003484084
and after listening a moment , she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry , and calling loudly after her 	2.2379157509773715
let her go then 	3.6515392425013213
in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more 	3.4114575712482162
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly 	2.4892450017301955
and she thought , more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire , than as she had seen him at pemberley 	3.3266097889082062
has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? " " your ladyship has declared it to be impossible 	2.8944427146340015
if he did shrug his shoulders , it was not till sir william was out of sight 	3.7936716764277727
one morning , about a week after bingley ' s engagement with jane had been formed , as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room , their attention was suddenly drawn to the window , by the sound of a carriage 	2.88920438145278
she was very wrong in singling me out as she did 	3.0796288698862786
" i am sorry it went off 	2.875778427035823
elizabeth said nothing , but it gratified her exceedingly 	3.209852137744885
" " you judge very properly , " said mr bennet , " and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy 	2.916395348768691
" not yet , " replied jane 	3.516298150907205
the park was very large , and contained great variety of ground 	2.3505536058952
when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness 	2.4834424866689613
she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable 	2.293410983009207
such a countenance , such manners ! and so extremely accomplished for her age ! her performance on the piano forte is exquisite 	2.1618605754843556
" they were now almost at the door of the house , for she had walked fast to get rid of him 	2.7778977803432126
" it was the prospect of constant society , and good society , " he added , " which was my chief inducement to enter the shire 	2.7510843714807707
after lamenting it however at some length , she had the consolation of thinking that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn , and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that , though he had been invited only to a family dinner , she would take care to have two full courses 	2.6512870326906985
his first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go 	2.811563731929093
and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother , and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance , particularly grateful to the daughter 	2.253024110577587
the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment 	3.3549675366842586
i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : i like them prodigiously 	2.3029295852653853
and though vanity had given her application , it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner , which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached 	2.461623582708065
and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship ' s carriage was ready to take them all home 	2.435266889895993
but the person who advanced , was now near enough to see her , and stepping forward with eagerness , pronounced her name 	3.240035146176801

her mother ' s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way , and she determined not to venture near her , lest she might hear too much 	2.457580153776562
" " were it certain that lady catherine would think so , " said mr collins very gravely " but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you 	2.7790625368463147
they will ruin your happiness 	3.012594973901458
it would be dreadful ! she blushed at the very idea 	2.860408326988849
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned 	2.900578616270761
" " but you will know it , when i have told you what happened the very next day 	2.8585116318413317
i know my own strength , and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming 	2.917313348264516
<num>	4.24676143746824
your ' s , &c 	3.257817285766595
the communication excited many professions of concern 	2.812796201556427
for he was discovered to be proud , to be above his company , and above being pleased 	2.6526184880944506
there , shut into her own room , as soon as their visitor left them , she could think without interruption of all that she had heard 	3.1708278982533202
when alone with elizabeth afterwards , she spoke more on the subject 	2.608634686200237
and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane , with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy 	2.618529518870611
elizabeth , who had a letter to write , went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea 	2.6791651211298153
and when i am in town it is pretty much the same 	2.812564819845114
" the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits , in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share 	2.5044983088278183
in seeing bingley , her thoughts naturally flew to her sister 	3.2543262723133837
" but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point , as well as the still more interesting one of bingley ' s being withheld from seeing jane , she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her , on examination , that she did not consider it entirely hopeless 	2.58781443629157
she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass , the quiet tenor of their usual employments , the vexatious interruptions of mr collins , and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings 	3.0525471917699605
to the girls , who could not listen to their cousin , and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument , and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle piece , the interval of waiting appeared very long 	2.9371959937977072
mr darcy had been at her sister ' s wedding 	4.091095437888537
but that is not the case here 	3.812333633700837
mr collins ' s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter , to whom they could give little fortune 	2.336088207696292
and nothing therefore remained to be done , but to think well of them both , to defend the conduct of each , and throw into the account of accident or mistake , whatever could not be otherwise explained 	2.346156580659663
i have no such injuries to resent 	3.7278274577984845
" i did not think caroline in spirits , " were her words , " but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london 	3.1936313832236456
that was impossible 	4.104773249053903
they are gone down to newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , i do not know how long 	2.7809149002961204
they have each their advantages , and i can be equally happy in either 	2.928478432854559
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd 	2.7255557870599447
clement ' s , because wickham ' s lodgings were in that parish 	3.6251276774474577
it was the second week in may , in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street , for the town of in hertfordshire 	2.5181358800632623
every disposition of the ground was good 	2.872420684778365
a great deal more passed at the other table 	3.4091446236989693
though , when the letters were read , elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen 	2.595655237553479
and soon laying it wholly aside , she drew near the card table , and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister , to observe the game 	2.6192671607397955
mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party 	2.590143784083915
she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment 	2.7757817857127067
and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november , for had it been otherwise , i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace 	2.0884594087211017
" for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds 	3.1456826396988635
miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl , and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose 	2.3819006145060295
" they were brightened by the exercise 	4.5292268678220395
and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady ' s removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at clapham 	2.674894015603624
and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes , but his eagerness to grasp at any thing 	3.2959862304475727
she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow 	2.2645273101427033
" but perhaps you would like to read it 	2.955960524819394
i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow 	2.623742926872378
she followed her father to the fire place , and they both sat down 	3.2986378074195577
the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life , and where they were now to spend a few days , was probably as great an object of her curiosity , as all the celebrated beauties of matlock , chatsworth , dovedale , or the peak 	2.832252781877693
i shall offer to pay him to morrow 	3.016200128543388
mrs bennet said only , " nonsense , nonsense ! " " what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? " cried he 	2.8731334821022854
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs , but on this happy day , she again took her seat at the head of her table , and in spirits oppressively high 	2.4659411471425914
he leaves out half his words , and blots the rest 	3.323726635825993
for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial 	2.8574180169993135
in a fortnight they were to go , and once gone , she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account 	2.556138197905877
she was ashamed to think how much 	3.013266362807114
oh ! lizzy , to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall i bear so much happiness ! " she then hastened away to her mother , who had purposely broken up the card party , and was sitting up stairs with kitty 	2.553789666506758
when i last saw her , she was not very promising 	3.754440335868569
what i have to say relates to poor lydia 	3.139609006946653
in understanding darcy was the superior 	3.0425464581987867
chapter xvi 	3.554720655478363
but elizabeth saw , with admiration of his taste , that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine 	2.735697987035977
" " let me be rightly understood 	2.851281935166022
things are settled so oddly 	3.167968359885135
mrs gardiner , who was several years younger than mrs bennet and mrs philips , was an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman , and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces 	2.618514867672997
a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other , and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two 	2.4951004354065835
lydia gaped as he opened the volume , and before he had , with very monotonous solemnity , read three pages , she interrupted him with , " do you know , mama , that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard , and if he does , colonel forster will hire him 	2.641834469264054
" " poor wickham 	3.1497362057716702
such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly 	3.2790877752672962
" " but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about 	2.4953797935104953
i am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose mr darcy ' s regard 	2.9166676227229322
by the author of " sense and sensibility 	2.006044895438726
" " but people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever 	2.235094265339274
if , indeed , such a report is in existence 	3.3726252969651807
sensible that if such an idea had been suggested , his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it 	2.367191423721502
she saw instantly that her cousin ' s manners were not altered by his marriage 	2.6395303680950066
the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again , called it an age since they had met , and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation 	2.2992559551795573
at length , every idea seemed to fail him 	2.6524461641744574
" " that will not do for a compliment to darcy , caroline , " cried her brother " because he does not write with ease 	2.6826589440871564
bingley likes your sister undoubtedly 	3.096219366417386
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed , and , while her courage was high , she immediately said , " mr darcy , i am a very selfish creature 	3.570218960782298
he had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein 	2.657869299588819
to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane , and must , at the same time , so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away , was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered , but the state of indecision in which she remained , as to the extent of what she should communicate 	3.0605323192446576
but satisfying them instantly on that head , she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons , reading the two letters aloud , and dwelling on the postscript of the last , with trembling energy 	2.3812548599769303
you alluded to something else 	2.9851229359751166
that is the place to get husbands 	3.3784797458140554
" i , who have prided myself on my discernment ! i , who have valued myself on my abilities ! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust 	2.2344431753127796
oh , brother , how kind you are ! i know you will contrive it all 	2.623293168009047
besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the shire have left meryton , and they are going in a fortnight 	2.8700287402267413
and elizabeth , who knew what curiosities his letters always were , looked over her , and read it likewise 	2.7613983918330067
" " you are very cruel , " said her sister , " you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment 	3.1682772344591834
" and pray tell her from me , that she cannot expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal 	3.731393083611603
and then till her sister came down , she had to listen to all he had to say , of his own happiness , and of jane ' s perfections 	3.521619260959135
elizabeth listened as little as she could , but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham ' s name 	3.116517198146935
" but now that my dear uncle is come , i hope every thing will be well 	2.6718072238643917
but she was flattered and pleased 	2.947931981170781
he merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention 	2.8119855008016885
the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side , allowed them to see him before they met 	2.590339401870339
her mother stepped forwards , embraced her , and welcomed her with rapture 	4.8833519820044575
" very well and this offer of marriage you have refused ? " " i have , sir 	3.22394798468047
while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind , she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl , whom it was impossible he could marry for money 	2.5080356822706795
he had liberality , and he had the means of exercising it 	4.988979069787677
which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption , she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister , had been formed before he quitted the inn , and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there , had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend 	2.279726356429724
the easy assurance of the young couple , indeed , was enough to provoke him 	2.9781961606375607
your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with 	2.9657924845942074
" if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield , " said mrs bennet to her husband , " and all the others equally well married , i shall have nothing to wish for 	3.2103798085908664
i expected you to stay two months 	2.828710860905878
i know your disposition , lizzy 	3.1323244982405742
the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire , lest she should suffer from the change of room 	2.3173838548884835
" mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character 	2.4284713903043325
some people call him proud 	3.331212563300989
well , monday morning came , and i was in such a fuss ! i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then i should have gone quite distracted 	3.314063083750861
oh ! that abominable mr darcy ! my father ' s opinion of me does me the greatest honour 	2.7515479871453734
but in spite of all this fine talking , my dear lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for another _ in the affair 	2.6202319971659276
" jane went to him instantly , kissed him , and thanked him for his goodness 	2.7511112121906782
" " you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner 	2.347471161177853
you may imagine what i felt and how i acted 	2.7281490472280656
but would my giving you the wished for promise , make their marriage at all more probable ? supposing him to be attached to me , would my refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? allow me to say , lady catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged 	2.180074943952087
the project gutenberg literary archive foundation ( " the foundation " or pglaf ), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of project gutenberg tm electronic works 	2.0767772353712837
and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which i should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that we shall take no offence 	2.5721520973786043
" jane and elizabeth looked at each other , and the waiter was told that he need not stay 	2.9432073422793876
with less of splendor , and more real elegance , than the furniture of rosings 	3.4492849590885704
i rather wonder now at your knowing any 	2.669444457239335
but this was declined , and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness 	2.725806103599836
darcy , in wretched suspense , could only say something indistinctly of his concern , and observe her in compassionate silence 	2.7486092505645696
and all was soon right again 	2.997079913501858

when she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it 	3.725085645331428
mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination , and when she ceased speaking , replied thus , " my dear miss elizabeth , i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy 	2.6357026973562125
pardon me 	4.7542129422365615
her nose wants character 	3.4427643486205324
why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after 	2.740120766779765
" you cannot be more than twenty , i am sure , therefore you need not conceal your age 	2.897629117248897
it was to remain the whole winter , and meryton was the head quarters 	2.624275809931677
" " an easy distance do you call it ? it is nearly fifty miles 	2.4369160035794244

" however little mr darcy might have liked such an address , he contented himself with coolly replying , that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned , no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer 	2.0823577095201116
her home and her housekeeping , her parish and her poultry , and all their dependent concerns , had not yet lost their charms 	2.434724026427342
i cannot think of it without abhorrence 	3.5200992636199344
at present , however , i consider myself as quite fixed here 	3.172324627780298
her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way 	3.121818824478971

but however he did not 	4.133599046456582
adieu to disappointment and spleen 	3.1845224155067253
they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds 	4.2620557051284615
can i speak plainer ? do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart 	2.2530804503290645
" " oh ! then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you 	2.467524329373693

" do not you want to know who has taken it ? " cried his wife impatiently 	3.0544129041473824
we must trespass a little longer on your kindness 	3.0595353096163533
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , lizzy ? " elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here 	2.887085231632815
the supposition did not pain her 	2.9024079960376334
when first mr bennet had married , economy was held to be perfectly useless 	2.425122340409178
at our time of life , it is not so pleasant i can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day 	3.151043306073038
she dared not relate the other half of mr darcy ' s letter , nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend 	2.7339158843117946
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself , but his manners were always so pleasing , that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought , his smiles and his easy address , while he claimed their relationship , would have delighted them all 	2.4372227995083273
at first 	4.643589737141051
as the weather was fine , they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park 	2.4022428468305366
he was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her 	2.505833665404126
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor 	2.6104622198007825
my mind was more agreeably engaged 	3.5304111256149104
her reflections were in general satisfactory 	3.2405623017929237
inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care 	3.2607316855559723
what are men to rocks and mountains ? oh ! what hours of transport we shall spend ! and when we do return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing 	2.4422938608898144
hatred had vanished long ago , and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him , that could be so called 	2.6860511236599605
her uncle and aunt stopped also , and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building , the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road , which led behind it to the stables 	2.4618569842427322
if he had _ motive , i am sure it would never disgrace him 	3.2256457060372115
it was a subject , in short , on which reflection would be long indulged , and must be unavailing 	3.3732103474213635
these causes must be stated , though briefly 	4.178038879829403
" chapter xxi 	2.967503856688297
" " i know them a little 	3.0408305304673005
two days after mr bennet ' s return , as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house , they saw the housekeeper coming towards them , and , concluding that she came to call them to their mother , went forward to meet her 	2.8260053885119207
for lady catherine , he added , so heartily approved his marriage , that she wished it to take place as soon as possible , which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men 	2.4338531277994586
the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner , and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension , as he had himself experienced from lady catherine 	2.5281960223505933
i must conclude , for i cannot be long from my poor mother 	3.046426840392493
she retreated from the window , fearful of being seen 	3.1903390096261504
such a circumstance could only exasperate farther , and when he ceased , the colour rose into her cheeks , and she said , " in such cases as this , it is , i believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned 	2.6194452692034496
" " are you , indeed ? and pray what sort of guardians do you make ? does your charge give you much trouble ? young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way 	2.104146481927328
mary , however , continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them 	2.8632369038977323
how shall we punish him for such a speech ? " " nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , " said elizabeth 	3.00011328792438
and then you must stay all night 	2.747606347227641
i told you in the library , you know , that i should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word 	3.331300425839342
each of them deep in thought 	3.816970557157565
and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do 	2.321943415487416
" " how can you contrive to write so even ? " he was silent 	2.5329487899424943
and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room 	2.516459783453447
his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination , were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding , but was very unlikely to recommend his suit 	2.543250740616044
their other engagements were few 	3.233926740138272
and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance , of his having ten thousand a year 	2.509524248112688
it was a better sized room , and had a pleasanter aspect 	3.2555395031577947
sir william had been delighted with him 	2.7388857571672003
" " laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion 	2.8445893740043324
" do not give way to useless alarm , " added he , " though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain 	2.48680730205032
" but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley ' s salutation 	3.146717504830149
but she had her share of business as well as her aunt , and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton , with false excuses for their sudden departure 	2.5355964401798095
but such as they were , it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them , and what a contrariety of emotion they excited 	3.058368860115325
" the gentlemen came 	3.823074313675229
" then , after a short silence , he continued , " lizzy , i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind 	2.3465104555550016
that lady i suppose is your mother 	3.104637949197777
mrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls , and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him 	2.6338800619838585
surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement 	3.4089011483537304
it needed all jane ' s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity 	2.3768572655279616
if i may so express it , he has a right to be proud 	3.2700838569492037
i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield 	2.7566223631787268
here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell 	2.502919045516964
if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham , you must be very happy 	3.064378612080848
the very last evening was spent there 	3.043424286242264
" on miss lucas ' s persevering , however , she added , " very well 	3.826436527333939
" as she spoke , she observed him looking at her earnestly , and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness , convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth 	2.589758831212307
by her ease and liveliness , his mind might have been softened , his manners improved , and from his judgment , information , and knowledge of the world , she must have received benefit of greater importance 	2.7322183698794786
it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible 	2.5065645515775667
" it would be nothing 	4.931956197988264
but , however , do not speak to mr darcy about it , if you had rather not 	3.5569751508673275
but their father , though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure , was really glad to see them 	2.785752733152795
i will put on my things in a moment 	2.6860015973590006
" " and do you impute it to either of those ? " " yes 	2.680219565341001
he spoke of apprehension and anxiety , but his countenance expressed real security 	2.5118744295542688
chapter xxii 	2.740340420276896
can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? oh ! no 	2.482674404677351
his behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire 	2.511865342338825
consider mr collins ' s respectability , and charlotte ' s prudent , steady character 	2.8049510086815066
and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last 	2.423796204161614
many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter 	3.161459372289421
" " removed ! " cried bingley 	3.359113807207882
and nothing less than a dance on tuesday , could have made such a friday , saturday , sunday and monday , endurable to kitty and lydia 	2.8170893249315188
and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected 	2.447663495235598
these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce 	2.772889191863935
" " i like her appearance , " said elizabeth , struck with other ideas 	2.6836199067581576
" having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event , let me now add a short hint on the subject of another : of which we have been advertised by the same authority 	2.411850301421026
he hardly ever mentioned your name 	2.991880440305978
thus , we do not necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper edition 	2.3160451667410684
for the curiosity excited by his long absence , burst forth in such very direct questions on his return , as required some ingenuity to evade , and he was at the same time exercising great self denial , for he was longing to publish his prosperous love 	2.862309856422427
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? to congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? " elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment 	2.0760146433780218
when i went away , i felt that it would soon happen 	3.3667046805098
but it is to the credit of his modesty 	3.1510011477166087
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me 	2.595798192180749
" chapter iv 	3.1865771584191465
but now we may be silent 	2.994688599730404
and if the second , i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire 	2.4342589087568656
mr bennet had very often wished , before this period of his life , that , instead of spending his whole income , he had laid by an annual sum , for the better provision of his children , and of his wife , if she survived him 	2.7448972746632028
she has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever 	2.1659280421504667
jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all , and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever 	2.7047143857161267
" " i do , i do like him , " she replied , with tears in her eyes , " i love him 	3.227452500515703
your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why i come 	2.3327179236767828
she had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks 	2.964340944163737
for she received an invitation from mrs forster , the wife of the colonel of the regiment , to accompany her to brighton 	2.925548842936338
a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her , a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude , and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter 	2.573871882403493
" " if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it 	2.3733614665062244
mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied 	3.2595574593198293
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world 	2.984631321266103
she was quite amazed at her own discomposure 	2.9905394894933
that she had a new gown , or a new parasol , which she would have described more fully , but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry , as mrs forster called her , and they were going to the camp 	3.116571245554787
with respect to wickham , the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation 	2.897141663469047
" i see your design , bingley , " said his friend 	3.4100308303677718
you may copy it , give it away or re use it under the terms of the project gutenberg license included with this ebook or online at <url> <num>	1.8279188642009763
but it had not been so in derbyshire 	3.400158173805028
" " elizabeth , you are not serious now 	3.8495908894596287
after this day , jane said no more of her indifference 	3.033259603497597
it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week 	2.756671485841243
" i did not know that you intended to walk , " said miss bingley , in some confusion , lest they had been overheard 	3.2146000222226414
his debts are to be paid , amounting , i believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his commission purchased 	3.067281017968176
" elizabeth was so much caught by what passed , as to leave her very little attention for her book 	2.751991472881959
when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do 	2.4507992007975297
and she would , at times , have given any thing to be privileged to tell him , that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family 	3.1857092192133156
good heaven ! brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of meryton 	3.1628251106763483
" elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment ' s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible , she sat down again , and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion 	2.2631114671294723
very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia , whose own misery was extreme , and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family 	2.3857966474689407
there is but such a quantity of merit between them 	3.5815236910049086
the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial , and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded , as having passed at the netherfield ball , and as confirming all his first disapprobation , could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers 	2.4718934366697374
i shall never forget her appearance this morning 	2.683563973307044
a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is 	3.048141121697831
kitty was the only one who shed tears 	3.124592066016463
the account of his connection with the pemberley family , was exactly what he had related himself 	2.5204464756100804
his affection was proved to have been sincere , and his conduct cleared of all blame , unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend 	2.7312022382649856
kitty , run down and order the carriage 	2.736694118807676
she could think of nothing but of mr wickham , and of what he had told her , all the way home 	3.2281404738335135
every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world 	3.199511720125049
and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me 	2.3848790995439475
they then went away 	3.514424873107071
but on the following morning , every hope of this kind was done away 	2.4911929763224876
i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life 	2.8162044220405265
if he were so , they could not succeed 	3.467139202278327

they may be modified and printed and given away you may do practically anything with public domain ebooks 	2.2619064757036584
" lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey , and as she did not answer them all herself , attention was necessary , which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her 	2.4661513843155602
though it was some time , i confess , before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice 	2.5824057567701533
for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation 	2.1268470524870544
but now , as bingley ' s friend and your husband , there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me 	2.495097070358723
a low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing 	3.003184461968992
" and this is always the way with him , " she added 	3.3373846246294154
for she had a lively , playful disposition , which delighted in any thing ridiculous 	2.7956277649176555

they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother 	2.5604752336066032
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained 	2.767265789990639
are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? " " no really , " replied elizabeth 	3.19587118317861
and wickham had constant admission to the house 	3.6208522251997306
and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor 	2.90540187433477
she had a sister married to a mr philips , who had been a clerk to their father , and succeeded him in the business , and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade 	2.846018536171953
" " true , " said mr bennet , " but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it 	2.829449392599405
elizabeth thought this was going pretty far 	2.7955430987869674
it was necessary to laugh , when she would rather have cried 	2.776565811114245
how can you be so teazing ? " " i honour your circumspection 	3.393804268550127
and after observing mr collins for a few moments , he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh 	2.359557329588357
and why not to me ? if he fears me , why come hither ? if he no longer cares for me , why silent ? teazing , teazing , man ! i will think no more about him 	2.1392733828931094
mr collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said , thanking her for every fish he won , and apologising if he thought he won too many 	2.1139423232926604
" " i suspected as much , " replied elizabeth 	2.8100476997230674
our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia ' s character 	2.705210114994291
under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief 	3.131452947891892
what a fine thing for our girls ! " " how so ? how can it affect them ? " " my dear mr bennet , " replied his wife , " how can you be so tiresome ! you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them 	3.0992443583153158
she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , mrs hurst and miss bingley 	2.574975991218334
" " it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends 	2.916968075531322
i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on 	2.845727251772368
his disposition must be dreadful 	3.4705344871612542
for it gratified him , he said , to discover that charlotte lucas , whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible , was as foolish as his wife , and more foolish than his daughter ! jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match 	2.3461866760354466
had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these , what would have been her sensations ? they could have been understood only by her mother , who might have felt nearly the same 	2.5668318315818976
at five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress , and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner 	2.266907981049848
" and with these words he hastily left the room , and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house 	2.4381263757922507
you wanted me , i know , to say 'yes ,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste 	3.0406448608779053
mrs bennet had no turn for economy , and her husband ' s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income 	2.5200196614936203
and , in the imprudence of anger , took the first opportunity of saying , with sneering civility , " pray , miss eliza , are not the shire militia removed from meryton ? they must be a great loss to your family 	2.521525952625247
" " he is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man 	2.8493717978774753
have you never happened to see her there ? " she was perfectly sensible that he never had 	3.0030940670265984
mr darcy ' s letter , she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart 	3.2683104899775763
but she was proud of him 	2.9757225662375073
" scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning , but their visit to rosings 	2.900963435857893
" elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied , " yes , you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that 	2.6537528867524642
his understanding and opinions all please me 	2.586861431378045
" i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her 	2.981103203974253
" " these are heavy misfortunes , " replied elizabeth 	2.6475291306776705
and even mr darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done 	2.8757124642711585
she was on the point of continuing her walk , when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park 	3.5628348199535735
chapter ix 	3.554720655478363
he studies too much for words of four syllables 	2.940243528460506
i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies 	3.959257243715438
but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way 	2.2509128445396684
i can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side 	2.620930871188934
mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter , and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself , instead of a ceremonious card 	2.3943058855511725
but what is that to me ? if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , i shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh 	2.568612323214403
my father began life in the profession which your uncle , mr philips , appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property 	2.439910671100774
" there , mrs bennet 	3.986883513655241
the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master , who was coming down in a day or two , to shoot there for several weeks 	2.5895538721050455
will you be very angry with me , my dear lizzy , if i take this opportunity of saying ( what i was never bold enough to say before ) how much i like him 	2.6761534218761946
in that county , there was enough to be seen , to occupy the chief of their three weeks 	3.9415640443386155
<num>	4.24676143746824
in this room they were received by miss darcy , who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley , and the lady with whom she lived in london 	2.911015625199929
it is evident that you belong to the first circles 	3.9469437385893764
and , on the father ' s , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families 	4.161542141792983

you need not 	4.290373778396331
" " i dislike it very much , " he replied 	2.8526586085437984
" we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , " said mrs gardiner , " but perhaps to the lakes 	3.0124233038470978
" i do not blame jane , " she continued , " for jane would have got mr bingley , if she could 	3.620833827449282
a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed , she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself 	2.682244624345426
when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet , she turned suddenly towards him and said , " by the bye , charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield ? i would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party 	2.1933708735643545
that he is to take possession before michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week 	3.280859480068326
elizabeth was in agonies 	3.8981891861357365
but , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if i still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion 	2.2602624878430375
" lizzy , you must not do so 	4.223750813402837
mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets 	3.3091463105870615
" " aye that is because you have the right disposition 	2.4759271946427717
though their kindness to jane , such as it was , had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother ' s admiration 	2.6829267034718156
but not long was the interval of tranquillity 	2.741788266639922
perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice 	2.78245156511209
" darcy mentioned his letter 	3.1697813005775464
" this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence , and the little value he put on his own good qualities 	2.65137003637299
" she did not choose it , " said her daughter , " she would go 	4.106808083471177
much had been done , and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday 	2.837484005974163
for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion , i should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil 	2.880984377441728

that speech savours strongly of disappointment 	2.7541225443639896
" i hope , my dear , " said mr bennet to his wife , as they were at breakfast the next morning , " that you have ordered a good dinner to day , because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party 	3.1426789020596138
but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule 	2.27626003841108
could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected 	3.5867490237537782
" " as often as i can 	2.987877328783892

if you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence 	2.6224375793544557

such very superior dancing is not often seen 	2.7732612905823935
" " but why all this secrecy ? why any fear of detection ? why must their marriage be private ? oh ! no , no , this is not likely 	2.3705308084084877
the situation of your mother ' s family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father 	2.2480123984823535
but nothing can be done 	3.2411153870213134
everything wore a happier aspect 	3.552385397270795
his anxiety for jane was evident , and his attentions to herself most pleasing , and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others 	2.5336232567099715
" " but upon my honour i do not 	3.331699203743407
she answered him in the usual way , and after a moment ' s pause , added , " my eldest sister has been in town these three months 	2.825413599320345
" " and then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books 	2.637076951459436
the part which i acted , is now to be explained 	2.728197021676312
perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand 	2.3847397360197133
but my feelings are not only cordial towards him 	2.7203263340034405
" only think of its being three months , " she cried , " since i went away 	2.7768398902149194
if you'll believe me , i did not once put my foot out of doors , though i was there a fortnight 	2.8418680698965524
she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her , must be the work of her brother , and without looking farther , it was satisfactory 	2.985410852864281
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and the children 	2.7907148834463014
determined , if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement , to apply to her father , whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive , and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female 	2.7098807235383
but on perceiving mr darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner 	2.1922804048254694
her prudent mother , occupied by the same ideas , forbore to invite him to sit by herself 	2.5651018506993504
pray go to see them , with sir william and maria 	3.198202632321771
howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins , but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter , to whom i have related the affair 	3.2832802966763537
" the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished 	2.7843315423714916
it was a large , handsome , stone building , standing well on rising ground , and backed by a ridge of high woody hills 	2.7380824702373614
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight 	2.420468445683925
when her father continued , " you look conscious 	3.8403225347881875
after sitting a few minutes , they were all sent to one of the windows , to admire the view , mr collins attending them to point out its beauties , and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer 	2.4841455757298037
" this was a sad omen of what her mother ' s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be 	2.9638689221652763
" and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable 	2.3272268525512736
" i am , dear sir , &c 	3.1179551948361137
james ' s 	3.380143181312107
her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow , and though she could not hear a word of it , she felt as if hearing it all , and saw in the motion of his lips the words " apology , " " hunsford , " and " lady catherine de bourgh 	3.081138144095413
" what an excellent father you have , girls , " said she , when the door was shut 	2.861658442945831
" " my fingers , " said elizabeth , " do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women ' s do 	2.7029077919184665
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family , they did not attempt to oppose it , for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants , while they waited at table , and judged it better that one only of the household , and the one whom they could most trust , should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject 	2.70125887744161
and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite 	2.5515275792931456
it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way 	3.370596255180764
elizabeth , for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother ' s thoughts , now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away 	2.38399892471092
elizabeth , construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister , was pleased 	3.3197932785490107
" and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out 	3.145816394070693
its effect was most extraordinary 	3.2780275289238605
there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it 	2.923780270242224
it is impossible 	3.893095685966605
she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals , but she dared not to believe it , and could not help saying so 	2.9088171748261384
and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give , which a just sense of shame would not conceal 	2.516114683706106
teaze him laugh at him 	3.3015791291395513
and felt , and said , for attention to any other objects 	3.50975416692662
and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend , met her with every appearance of composure 	2.536201022808356
" charlotte had hardly time to answer , before they were joined by kitty , who came to tell the same news , and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room , where mrs bennet was alone , than she likewise began on the subject , calling on miss lucas for her compassion , and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family 	2.566833798480388
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers 	2.2545331221830773
i congratulate her 	3.8564029333163226
and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men 	2.3432090754956603
she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference 	2.499518984359268
you have a sweet room here , mr bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk 	2.9099941941279086
" " yes but as it happens , they are all of them very clever 	2.784992343759382
dear me ! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster ' s 	2.357911969415084
" " i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing 	2.323193943946185
lady catherine it appeared , had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings , for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy 	2.4400049156688155
" wickham so very bad ! it is almost past belief 	2.6445843053989475
" good gracious ! " cried maria , after a few minutes silence , " it seems but a day or two since we first came ! and yet how many things have happened ! " " a great many indeed , " said her companion with a sigh 	2.725106743026434
charlotte ' s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness 	3.0863564104037002
" " i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match , " cried elizabeth 	2.6250342079138576
yes , miss bennet , interest 	4.096881382003076
with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am i wrong , my dearest jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? " " what think you of this sentence , my dear lizzy ? " said jane as she finished it 	2.6026132757379354
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park , unexpectedly meet mr darcy 	2.9183947201422376
" " such as vanity and pride 	2.872407254368283
" i am by no means of opinion , i assure you , " said he , " that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency 	2.531287921010892
for , what with her board and pocket allowance , and the continual presents in money , which passed to her , through her mother ' s hands , lydia ' s expences had been very little within that sum 	3.5087172066653824
i know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that i am not afraid of requesting it , though i have still something more to ask of the former 	2.9476760073777863
and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement 	2.7872016957126213
" for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy ' s steward , and of that , i can assure you , he informed me himself 	2.873022764694892
he readily agreed to it 	3.3955399119654386
she could only imagine however at last , that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible , according to his ideas of right , than in any other person present 	2.6100535244778205
at present i will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted " he was interrupted by a summons to dinner 	2.391178333576097
" her sister made not the smallest objection , and the piano forte was opened , and darcy , after a few moments recollection , was not sorry for it 	2.880029313823283
jane looked well , and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits , amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them 	2.4244513368709937
and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter , she found little , except the professed affection of the writer , that could give her any comfort 	3.1104039854450107
" i have just had a letter from jane , with such dreadful news 	3.1103555359692994
one seems so forlorn without them 	2.9946702812093577
" mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner 	2.53095349593409
" " upon my word ! well , that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however , it may all come to nothing you know 	2.076849267880109
and she felt capable under such circumstances , of endeavouring even to like bingley ' s two sisters 	2.5039364481890685
and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment ' s distress 	2.7262237491629864
he saw wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia 	3.1077321463241026
the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend , assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london , might be too much , she feared , for the strength of his attachment 	2.642069032368735
" " ah ! " cried mrs bennet , shaking her head , " then she is better off than many girls 	2.6696442852790097
you will not , i hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter ' s favour , without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf 	2.586918165671256
but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , i hope , quite so easily changed as that implies 	2.3984420303190697
" " i must think your language too strong in speaking of both , " replied jane , " and i hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together 	2.896806565581129
i have certainly meant well through the whole affair 	2.7478992685433496
she opened the door , and met maria in the landing place , who , breathless with agitation , cried out , " oh , my dear eliza ! pray make haste and come into the dining room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! i will not tell you what it is 	2.86911358067842
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there , that day 	2.4064011092766777
" how could i ever think her like her nephew ? " said she , as she looked in her face 	2.952591234291685
i should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company 	3.3029223169651405
and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand 	2.8920606627607084
" wickham ' s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look 	2.4548212820529685
" " kitty has no discretion in her coughs , " said her father 	3.5528805760277953
mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father , who had intended to purchase an estate , but did not live to do it 	2.6431476876085007
" miss bingley ' s congratulations to her brother , on his approaching marriage , were all that was affectionate and insincere 	3.099055922855282
elizabeth , at work in the opposite corner , saw it all with great delight 	2.4387221605160834
and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum 	2.096693158684635
she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk , when the recollection of mr darcy ' s sometimes coming there stopped her , and instead of entering the park , she turned up the lane , which led her farther from the turnpike road 	2.6425775998355454
she was convinced that she could have been happy with him 	3.7837382172494576
but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character 	2.1949567069503297
" is miss darcy much grown since the spring ? " said miss bingley 	2.8337231907990947
but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets , she soon grew too much interested in the game , too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes , to have attention for any one in particular 	2.2454438249067206
" " i am not now to learn , " replied mr collins , with a formal wave of the hand , " that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour 	2.8047872265938834
and from the observation of the day altogether , she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented 	2.6470795493396286
" " perhaps we might be deceived 	2.7207503053937794
it was a journey of only twenty four miles , and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon 	2.541620805825243
lady catherine , i believe , did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford 	2.9125451941259475
her air was not conciliating , nor was her manner of receiving them , such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank 	2.904846552192941
i only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , i imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe 	2.8260577618988743
to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine , and her daughter 	3.3475021148709923
my mother was in hysterics , and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done ! but the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties 	3.01062806102819
his understanding and temper , though unlike her own , would have answered all her wishes 	2.762192915171942
" oh ! yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well , and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again 	2.5886220218066005
" " i do assure you , sir , that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man 	3.267703374424645
she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas , who often joined them , and good naturedly engaged mr collins ' s conversation to herself 	2.636792502569032
" i am trying to make it out 	3.0765135368538234
" " you are over scrupulous surely 	2.8041421031383447
his sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own 	2.4580922228321773
what could be more natural than his asking you again ? he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room 	2.347597889386533
mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father ' s active superintendance , and when immediately before my father ' s death , mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him , as of affection to myself 	2.639360634357616
" this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret 	2.180283433237479
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all , or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself 	2.337308618315562
" " yes , indeed , " cried mrs bennet , offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood 	2.8063111016781432
elizabeth , with a triumphant sensation , looked towards his friend 	4.127875381336128
and , therefore , i am not afraid of speaking openly 	3.789460530448764
and as miss bingley , vexed and disappointed , dared not approach nearer to wickham , georgiana also recovered in time , though not enough to be able to speak any more 	2.4462541020836643
had lydia ' s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms , it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family , where to every other objection would now be added , an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned 	2.30665102796089
elizabeth was not surprised at it , as jane had written the direction remarkably ill 	2.6824302447804205
she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting 	2.6627592879263537
you had much better dance 	3.511886786515055
my uncle and aunt and i were to go together 	3.704693543563715
" wickham , perhaps , is my favourite 	3.291085158737835
and darcy , after looking at her for a moment , turned silently away 	2.9924191975279415
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression 	3.4275551570129656
again she read on 	3.5364552253283006
neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane 	2.5809157222690047
" " upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except netherfield 	2.185802614473447
the first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , i had detached mr bingley from your sister , and the other , that i had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of mr wickham 	3.441224653752227
i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit 	2.4964552763213654
" " can i have the carriage ? " said jane 	3.4091507777592733
but she still thought him partial to jane , and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend ' s permission , or being bold enough to come without it 	2.914171640394055
" how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning , mr darcy , " she cried 	3.2990292313965264
bingley was the principal spokesman , and miss bennet the principal object 	3.8939093897280417
if you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a project gutenberg tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement , you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph <num>	2.1559560355087872
do let me ask my partner to introduce you 	2.630064144466114
the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents , about a twelvemonth ago , was now brought forward again 	2.6507749980946427
sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves 	2.4733041943986516
jane was so admired , nothing could be like it 	2.7579618174858465
miss lucas is married and settled 	2.8794074189296253
they had long wished to see him 	3.390955924443412
the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness , was enough to interest all her tender feelings 	2.9738945638554406
" " i do not mind his not talking to mrs long , " said miss lucas , " but i wish he had danced with eliza 	2.8283114814913035
a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point , without being resented 	2.467361955629519
nay , were your friend lady catherine to know me , i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation 	2.5070893831612597
and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite 	2.294617782026324
they could describe an entertainment with accuracy , relate an anecdote with humour , and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit 	2.2999679953799097
" " shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? " said elizabeth , still addressing colonel fitzwilliam 	2.5771331230957575
and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house , walked quietly into it herself 	2.7369608627427913
" " i did not know before , " continued bingley immediately , " that you were a studier of character 	3.1783238974891908
its object was nothing less , than to secure her from any return of mr collins ' s addresses , by engaging them towards herself 	2.308839090139899
she is all affability and condescension , and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over 	2.59559598349961
mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday 	2.5456410340410165
the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first 	2.7671476577527265
five daughters successively entered the world , but yet the son was to come 	2.861502158102418
" yes , she called yesterday with her father 	3.2165590237033155
" the colour now rushed into elizabeth ' s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew , instead of the aunt 	2.7583663675303773
a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother ' s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade 	2.670953175547205
we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect 	2.578774247238426
his accompanying them was a double advantage 	3.5525876775352794
" " mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife 	2.3914620515241762
" " i dare say she will 	3.1746852690998226
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself 	2.5270822041443153
mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet , and mrs hurst was observing their game 	3.3466005776801833
it has often led him to be liberal and generous , to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor 	2.962618920921216
what congratulations will then flow in ! i appeal to mr darcy : but let me not interrupt you , sir 	2.509102560102693
and lydia , in a voice rather louder than any other person ' s , was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her 	2.8593990469355153
who could about such a nasty little freckled thing ? " elizabeth was shocked to think that , however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself , the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal ! as soon as all had ate , and the elder ones paid , the carriage was ordered 	2.574452954315747
but before they heard again from mr gardiner , a letter arrived for their father , from a different quarter , from mr collins 	2.523662891262952
and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours , miss elizabeth , for the two first dances especially , a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her 	2.4924208657237847
they were off saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight 	2.6296911559202902

and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille , while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh ' s foot stool , that she said , 'mr collins , you must marry 	2.8252562059851556
and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane , nor half so good humoured as lydia 	2.4744669548980487
" the wedding took place 	3.180298342014052
chapter vi 	2.740340420276896
we have not met since the <num>th of november , when we were all dancing together at netherfield 	2.887184291591751
" " i think you said she was a widow , sir ? has she any family ? " " she has one only daughter , the heiress of rosings , and of very extensive property 	3.2055438758969195
" while i can have my mornings to myself , " said she , " it is enough 	3.2467298204085475
his principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham 	2.2758140499108728
then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms 	2.8522870650764416
" " mr darcy is all politeness , " said elizabeth , smiling 	3.1915876084203907
mr bennet protested against any description of finery 	2.6155727397845774
when that business was over , he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music 	2.6659531859579113
" " it is amazing to me , " said bingley , " how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are 	3.381365947425708
on mr and mrs gardiner ' s coming up , they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment 	2.8569565931833565
you are not well enough 	3.797517517813902
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind 	2.760586043761276
" pray do , my dear miss lucas , " she added in a melancholy tone , " for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , i am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves 	2.676039575062691
mrs bennet could not give her consent , or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings , though she talked to bingley of nothing else , for half an hour 	2.3452597327518108
my dear lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us 	2.8893266707475527
after a short pause , her companion added , " you are too generous to trifle with me 	2.9731214801779333
the children have been wanting me this half hour 	2.595163778608168
but you are always giving her the preference 	3.0533443405736946
" " that is his notion of christian forgiveness ! the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte ' s situation , and his expectation of a young olive branch 	3.011357089383873
it is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast 	2.597950765975558
the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning ' s impatience 	2.8800905756147737
" elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy 	2.549352709994966
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion , with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode , and the improvements it was receiving , he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them 	3.1117076491898366
" this was praise , of all others most extraordinary , most opposite to her ideas 	2.192044054988195
i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good 	2.5140599515433797
	8.747380749600952
and if she might judge from his complexion , his mind was not very differently engaged 	2.510665923414217
" " yes , and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise 	2.774474294652528
i take up my pen again to do , what i have just told you i would not , but circumstances are such , that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible 	2.811971261356673
but self , though it would intrude , could not engross her 	4.087803882621912
" mr gardiner , whose manners were easy and pleasant , encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks 	2.3939882132176717
he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood 	2.2609713187498635
in that case he would return no more 	2.9069449120130337
this however was no evil to elizabeth , and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough 	2.656694205566385
in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health , imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better 	2.3274617458710063
the five weeks which she had now passed in kent , had made a great difference in the country , and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees 	2.9370545628459332
and you , yourself , when last at longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him 	2.497903470288967
their mutual affection will steady them 	2.779647528235621
" a place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected 	2.5530074457458514
" mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand 	2.9426938643831515
" " may i ask to what these questions tend ? " " merely to the illustration of your character , " said she , endeavouring to shake off her gravity 	2.622539894782007
" " they have none of them much to recommend them , " replied he 	3.135612612871884
i must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject 	3.7494315561433575
but at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain 	2.331494649681068
elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation 	2.3463974288958256
the foundation ' s principal office is located at <num> melan dr 	2.2680934913715842
elizabeth , who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been , was much relieved by discerning such different feelings 	2.91612402717322
mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking , mary could never spare time , but the remaining five set off together 	2.6500003785915
he was not seated by her 	3.412078855308978
and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there , recurring to her mind , the few minutes in which they continued together , were some of the most uncomfortable of her life 	2.700239281556175
after sitting a little while with jane , on miss bingley ' s appearance and invitation , the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour 	2.4327356729765848
" " miss bennet i am shocked and astonished 	2.5202983925492015
but attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior , the belief of her being proud and reserved 	2.166182521750829
" no one made any reply 	3.0526384763869374
my dear jane , i am in such a flutter , that i am sure i can't write 	4.86415406354199
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man 	2.5123542731386954
and the kind of half expectation which mrs gardiner had formed , of their being followed by a letter from him , had ended in nothing 	2.531125154903619
and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy , than the first vehemence of her disapprobation 	2.7122276754549914
" chapter vii 	3.5083826988037563
in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother , though expressed most concisely , he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done , and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him 	2.698455062479961
and it was but the other day , that i recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her 	3.015076760983305
and she looked on the whole scene , the river , the trees scattered on its banks , and the winding of the valley , as far as she could trace it , with delight 	3.0031519231233577
we passed each other several times 	2.8892827396764162
but on the third , her repining was over , and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once , on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere 	2.9348681542639956
information about donations to the project gutenberg literary archive foundation project gutenberg tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment 	2.068225761033872

special rules , set forth in the general terms of use part of this license , apply to copying and distributing project gutenberg tm electronic works to protect the project gutenberg tm concept and trademark 	2.440391706033435
his character was decided 	3.4748447910224805
mr bingley ' s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before 	2.459683635071851
recovering himself , however , shortly , he turned to his partner , and said , " sir william ' s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of 	2.607530301810411
upon this signal , the youngest of her daughters put herself forward 	3.49320051216897
she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way 	2.8892072041351633
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her 	2.5061625992111294
they had several children 	3.3856107749865965
" elizabeth made no answer 	2.484054540745506
seriously , i would have you be on your guard 	3.0634837210309156
how could i be so silly as to wish it ! your idea of the ponies is delightful 	2.474243926777426
and though her resolution was not to be shaken , her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation 	2.5984003527482114
he was at the same time haughty , reserved , and fastidious , and his manners , though well bred , were not inviting 	3.1343258222362564
and mrs bennet , in the meanwhile , was giving way to all the happy schemes , which the good humour , and common politeness of bingley , in half an hour ' s visit , had revived 	2.9220122812828966
i always said it must be so , at last 	3.0683765882973995
" elizabeth made no answer 	2.484054540745506
and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions 	2.8588487648540233
" " if i have , i shall be the last person to confess it 	3.408058816250059
and the girls smiled on each other 	3.09753278445168
miss darcy , though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations , readily obeyed 	2.486673642812131
he is , indeed 	4.061577637013421
his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had 	2.381508231856887
and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls 	2.345911629432591
it had been settled in the evening , between the aunt and niece , that such a striking civility as miss darcy ' s , in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley , for she had reached it only to a late breakfast , ought to be imitated , though it could not be equalled , by some exertion of politeness on their side 	2.765956988438849
" " speak to lizzy about it yourself 	2.588881002013026
having now a good house and very sufficient income , he intended to marry 	2.5227565922392414
" " there is some sense in what he says about the girls however 	2.4325024834666653
and if he is disposed to make them any amends , i shall not be the person to discourage him 	3.272154658318067
but , with many expressions of concern , he confessed himself engaged elsewhere 	2.3645880379898747
such amiable qualities must speak for themselves 	2.854955934030537
i cannot catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as i often see done 	2.430363133624191
he was moving that way 	3.003875858618416
all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return 	3.049947681940665
" " and if i had not a letter to write myself , i might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did 	2.822304480162274
his friend had given him the earliest information of it 	2.8620672911288354
" not yet , however , in spite of her disappointment in her husband , did mrs bennet give up the point 	2.9519983081508725
no one was to be put in competition with him 	3.082214231470982
" jane looked at her doubtingly 	3.5768895435352546
and what sort of table do they keep ? charlotte is an excellent manager , i dare say 	2.4839423620755188
" and is this all ? " cried elizabeth 	2.945296040895282
he was fond of the country and of books 	2.9835741879608078
in making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self reproach 	2.5061344659146165
elizabeth ' s collected behaviour , however , soon quieted his emotion 	3.954315577606583
and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , i hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr wickham 	2.6566957730322276
they met several times , for there was much to be discussed 	3.1030349053333817
such a disappointment ! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! it is really too distressing 	2.4367859385249724
jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback , and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day 	3.292006310103104
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity 	3.146444416822433
" " now , kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , " said mr bennet 	3.289780918444763
and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister ' s , mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man 	3.3193176583004878
" elizabeth hesitated , but her knees trembled under her , and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them 	2.7249681881306893
" " after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion 	2.1767189449003115
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters 	2.2415671591916713
and i particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at netherfield , 'she a beauty ! i should as soon call her mother a wit 	2.136539434770048
" elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case , and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts 	2.444353876070136
he assured her that as to dancing , he was perfectly indifferent to it 	3.1927938120944925
in this quiet way , the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away 	2.544833750992669
and as it had been asked without the least suspicion , she was not distressed by his repeating it 	2.8634763335773172
to convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point 	3.2464904046030543
" " and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty ? " " the indirect boast 	2.499190110622266
i really cannot laugh at it 	2.9514211981036143
i know very well that nothing can be done 	2.6475771001026116
his former acquaintance had been numerous 	3.580752971629126
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week 	2.329965430425475
while these newly born notions were passing in their heads , the perturbation of elizabeth ' s feelings was every moment increasing 	3.243051075191997
" and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly 	2.8805517309918693
but , to counterbalance these advantages , mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church , and his cousin could have none at all 	2.899355523506695
and in farther justification of mr darcy , she could not but allow that mr bingley , when questioned by jane , had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair 	3.412288837354949
" " your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you 	2.5607380473220274
but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless 	2.835457950354978
mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips 	2.274162296981978
adding , that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it 	3.8287390592053807
and lady lucas , who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing , was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken 	3.478493662686629
" but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing 	2.467709573994508
easter was approaching , and the week preceding it , was to bring an addition to the family at rosings , which in so small a circle must be important 	2.6630592723515494
my child , let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life 	3.058608220127297
how much you must have gone through ! " her sister , however , assured her , of her being perfectly well 	3.498748678952236
" you are joking , lizzy 	4.1196439709019925
by all that i have ever read , i am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary 	2.753824056286005
" elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment , before their approach was announced by the door bell , and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room 	2.38746911670385
" elizabeth , having rather expected to affront him , was amazed at his gallantry 	2.355158090414739
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man , who , but three months before , had been almost an angel of light 	2.8702787474350617
but i hope you will not mind it : it is all for jane ' s sake , you know 	3.115736463498192
i pity you , miss eliza , for this discovery of your favourite ' s guilt 	2.391714862042103
he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names 	2.8604593198162163
i dearly love a laugh 	2.9877374068185336
but with the rich , he is liberal minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable , allowing something for fortune and figure 	2.164264540204107
as soon as i get to town , i shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to gracechurch street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done 	2.7680691809883107
by the author of " sense and sensibility 	2.006044895438726
but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford , her love of solitary walks , and her opinion of mr and mrs collins ' s happiness 	2.597724083648664
and while sir william accompanied him , charlotte took her sister and friend over the house , extremely well pleased , probably , to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband ' s help 	2.480627903988159
but mrs bennet , who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday , which would exactly finish jane ' s week , could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before 	2.4928710441459443
" i am perfectly ready , i assure you , to keep my engagement 	2.9018940018298247
for in a quarter of an hour ' s tête à tête with mrs bennet before breakfast , a conversation beginning with his parsonage house , and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes , that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn , produced from her , amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement , a caution against the very jane he had fixed on 	2.153452882379817
and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino , the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her party 	2.7438225728084005
his choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing 	2.717576538345287
were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain 	2.4586629711694044
" " you are a very strange creature by way of a friend ! always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body ! if my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers 	2.418150463793893
haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week 	3.624450767547317
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay 	2.658841794112096
i am glad it occurred to me to mention it 	3.3137719128730776
with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart 	3.06214404671656
that such a consequence as this should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts 	2.548559674511618
" mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham ' s removal from the shire , as clearly as mr gardiner could do 	2.332904376714891
i told my sister philips so the other day 	2.9328964283227257
" " who do you mean , my dear ? i know of nobody that is coming i am sure , unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in , and i hope my dinners are good enough for her 	2.6782655548987857
but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness 	2.2922814713593884
but her conclusion was false 	2.988527048332737
but his perfect indifference , and your pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! much as i abominate writing , i would not give up mr collins ' s correspondence for any consideration 	2.556602251116764
as long as she stays there , it is all very well 	4.038008048083586
what sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? if they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us 	2.3123962659087134
she related the subject of the pictures , the dimensions of the rooms , and the price of the furniture , in vain 	4.4182297931738646
" so , lizzy , " said he one day , " your sister is crossed in love i find 	3.258637123685742
we now come to the point 	3.5410764835127178
and her fear , if she once entered on the subject , of being hurried into repeating something of bingley , which might only grieve her sister farther 	2.6707893186417526
but your arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family 	2.9913960313184296
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man , whom they had never seen before , of most gentleman like appearance , walking with an officer on the other side of the way 	2.357279735688049
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these 	2.9325694568004326
it was the last of the regiment ' s stay in meryton , and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace 	2.8507469157793492
from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents 	3.5509404001661036
" mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered , and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication 	2.1947694453912012
she began at length to recover , to fidget about in her chair , get up , sit down again , wonder , and bless herself 	2.334488664379793
for a few moments , indeed , she felt that he would probably strike into some other path 	3.185644732617666
but their progress was slow , for mr gardiner , though seldom able to indulge the taste , was very fond of fishing , and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water , and talking to the man about them , that he advanced but little 	2.8221118829987035
i am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me 	2.6953798634745323
" mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he ? poor eliza ! to be only just tolerable 	2.4613570501256894
mrs bennet and kitty walked off , and as soon as they were gone mr collins began 	3.0675056927751885
he came , and in such very good time , that the ladies were none of them dressed 	3.6195981031659463
" what does mr darcy mean , " said she to charlotte , " by listening to my conversation with colonel forster ? " " that is a question which mr darcy only can answer 	2.817242825423438
one morning , soon after their arrival , as she was sitting with her two elder sisters , she said to elizabeth , " lizzy , i never gave you an account of my wedding , i believe 	2.927902606779779
it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case 	3.152949785294517
" " mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself ? " " no 	3.2632128950910007
and yet , it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham 	3.1395712581092807
by this time she is actually with them ! if such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! what a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! " " we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , " said jane : " i hope and trust they will yet be happy 	2.4111648810824082
" books oh ! no 	3.3291235214082424
and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn 	2.3960314105109717
but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others , and she had no opportunity of detaining them 	3.346003270303063
and the other , how i am ever to pay him 	2.9619977951885312
intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done 	3.530872684775249
secondly , that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness 	3.171983405702079
" in darcy ' s presence she dared not mention wickham ' s name 	3.3313090789963886
absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again , and weakened her disgust of mr collins 	3.120663138135082
they were more disturbed , more unequal , than she had often seen them 	3.1072768049064976
she had gained her point , and had time to consider of it 	2.8784652335750955
it originated in mrs gardiner , who , fatigued by the exercise of the morning , found elizabeth ' s arm inadequate to her support , and consequently preferred her husband ' s 	2.8192310840064514
till the latter walked away from her , and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte , stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer ' s countenance 	2.422054196689211
you have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him 	3.1699279145780137
any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have been left as printed 	2.5975703872409364
but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father 	2.3686542697348067
a most convenient distance for the young ladies , who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week , to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner ' s shop just over the way 	2.224625808328459
" this roused a general astonishment 	2.7884155592654767
" " have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? " " oh ! yes 	2.970598199089529
" " my uncle is to send a servant for us 	2.5291853671529188
" the picture gallery , and two or three of the principal bed rooms , were all that remained to be shewn 	2.375559623704426
she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter 	3.1535745802346025
" elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded 	2.250624794016449
yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman ' s proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of 	3.0975325533432527
" most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote 	2.2489765293784862
but unable to waste such a precious occasion , she suddenly got up , and saying to kitty , " come here , my love , i want to speak to you , " took her out of the room 	2.901300085526393
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others 	2.592818437587473
when coffee was over , colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him 	2.5495125863217214
" " and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good , " added kitty 	2.5698764507652068
it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh ' s family 	2.5817042198168787
lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations 	4.381128435644238
if you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment 	3.2571598280175045
is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief ? a glass of wine 	2.815423269941884
" you began the evening well , charlotte , " said mrs bennet with civil self command to miss lucas 	2.6706991699854314
" miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit , and threw back the praise on her sister ' s warm affection 	2.370174964308329
" " i should not be surprised , " said darcy , " if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers 	3.364349103055705
had his first appearance , or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining , been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy , the gardener ' s expression of surprise , on beholding his master , must immediately have told it 	2.393949868474008
" indeed , jane , you ought to believe me 	3.6383524941333225
elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution 	2.821395294800654
this room was my late master ' s favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then 	2.3706169488438222
" " oh ! my dear brother , " replied mrs bennet , " that is exactly what i could most wish for 	2.9944306427202814
he is so excessively handsome ! and his sisters are charming women 	2.629247284294677
" " it is not mr bingley , " said her husband 	4.041367407597442
your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know 	2.4790021998376277
" my father and maria are to come to me in march , " added charlotte , " and i hope you will consent to be of the party 	3.544010276723644
" how abominable ! i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you ! if from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest , for dishonesty i must call it 	2.5711312235621633
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister 	2.338061840456756
" " i am afraid you do not like your pen 	3.279171386221296
kitty is slight and delicate , and mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on 	2.5326974484040736
she wrote cheerfully , seemed surrounded with comforts , and mentioned nothing which she could not praise 	2.768806624146557
so imprudent a match on both sides ! but i am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood 	2.8245648150606657
my good opinion once lost is lost for ever 	2.3607888941688047
my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly , to try to discover her 	2.3656632073713135
" it is unlucky , " said she , after a short pause , " that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country 	3.0208812241011387
and if i were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , i dare say i should adopt it 	2.640937235507532
" elizabeth could bear it no longer 	2.7093716173820788
he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be , and unconsciously closed his book 	3.04647198626831
every savage can dance 	3.5059437228270127
i told mrs collins so before you came 	2.835753017795455
and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections 	2.714776727340639
" they have both , " said she , " been deceived , i dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea 	2.918125642332179
elizabeth , who was left by herself , now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled , that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation 	2.196176144952483
elizabeth hoped she had silenced him 	3.8180829079291145
if i wished to think slightingly of any body ' s children , it should not be of my own however 	2.84359902932663
her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed , a mixture of pride and impertinence 	2.734880689298002
" from the very beginning , from the first moment i may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike 	2.4883429213662347
" " indeed , mr collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary 	2.8356653018347733
" " i am not afraid of you , " said he , smilingly 	3.1947210197578197
" your ' s , &c 	3.102496573800538
it must be an amusing study 	3.5843904502721844
" i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society 	2.676844930413445
but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley , she dropt all her resentment 	2.707020845097222
it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge 	2.874402625143611
lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex 	2.3294791759510733
yes , i call it a very easy distance 	3.021991815138275
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , i shall certainly not depart from it 	2.5415017100851602
i hate such false friends 	2.9933666446826193
she has got over the most trying age 	2.6960994371402283
give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you cannot greatly err 	2.2896535232692234
but with me , it is not so 	5.179040254035419
i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection 	3.209326622874214
<num>	4.24676143746824
for mrs bennet , having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference , no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase , than she entered the breakfast room , and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection 	2.604148213357972
" he smiled , and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said 	2.6832397685946963
you cannot refuse to dance , i am sure , when so much beauty is before you 	2.678036286906644
resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all 	2.53988973608118
attention , forbearance , patience with darcy , was injury to wickham 	3.241381210080188
" chapter xviii 	2.967503856688297
however , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and i am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves 	2.6417831773366838
and besides , it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body , and had so many favourites 	2.8172818893824503
and if they are not married already , make them marry 	2.706090837691209
the business was therefore soon settled 	3.048053131317444
mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride 	2.7467718667276735
you supposed more than really existed 	2.90504177197753
after an affectionate parting between the friends , elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr collins , and as they walked down the garden , he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family , not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter , and his compliments to mr and mrs gardiner , though unknown 	2.8488053836930955
bingley was punctual to his appointment 	4.847613749058644
and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome 	2.2172219070924593
" " it was a subject which they could not mention before me 	3.238773417036474
they entered the woods , and bidding adieu to the river for a while , ascended some of the higher grounds 	2.850599330374918
but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person 	3.187220532495997
remember that she is one of a large family 	3.3769933291891983
i cannot misunderstand you , but i intreat you , dear lizzy , not to pain me by thinking that _ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk 	2.542599960169904
" " an excellent consolation in its way , " said elizabeth , " but it will not do for us 	3.0297321857200297
i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you 	2.891912414350625
now be sincere 	3.977973492110107
" " from mr collins ! and what can he have to say ? " " something very much to the purpose of course 	2.9415914906324026
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned 	2.331700956377479
with such rivals for the notice of the fair , as mr wickham and the officers , mr collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance 	2.9519439747424814
he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend 	2.9461205925318485
" " your attendance upon her , has been too much for you 	2.9154064338248182
miss darcy , on her brother ' s entrance , exerted herself much more to talk 	3.279256209322387
whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish 	2.2720342808755967
" elizabeth , feeling really anxious , was determined to go to her , though the carriage was not to be had 	3.171066631355989
i had often seen him in love before 	3.118807053754782
it was as follows : " my dear sir , " i feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire 	2.8085998700126926
it was , on the contrary , exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes 	2.7983022152250827
i have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle 	3.7766045507763817
he has given in all his debts 	3.123868333061985
lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others , or relating some anecdote of herself 	2.9545357588207346
" " heaven forbid ! that would be the greatest misfortune of all ! to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate ! do not wish me such an evil 	2.155955688622776
it was consoling , that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush 	2.6932247939805003
kitty stared at him , and lydia exclaimed 	3.9201944922170275
it was a handsome modern building , well situated on rising ground 	2.5416548093080804
pray , how violent _ mr bingley ' s love ? " " i never saw a more promising inclination 	3.158359663603826
but now it was all too natural 	3.265694859311457
she followed him with her eyes , envied every one to whom he spoke , had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee 	2.4612163356243975
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned , in terms of such mortifying , yet merited reproach , her sense of shame was severe 	2.471855827153071
a clergyman like you must marry 	3.027144633663026
" * * * * * it may be easily believed , that however little of novelty could be added to their fears , hopes , and conjectures , on this interesting subject , by its repeated discussion , no other could detain them from it long , during the whole of the journey 	2.090726615359673
i will go directly to mr bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , i am sure 	3.3499588376096505
" " but if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out 	2.505319505459675
there is a lady , it seems , a mrs younge , who was some time ago governess to miss darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what 	3.033200798216469
to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr robinson 	2.1315030938759136
" " i beg your pardon 	2.441540931569225
you cannot have been always at longbourn 	3.2044410160548655
" elizabeth shook her head over this letter 	2.7618774498434644
" this part of his intelligence , though unheard by lydia , was caught by elizabeth , and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham ' s absence than if her first surmise had been just , every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment , that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make 	2.4390651610270466
" " mama , " cried lydia , " my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson ' s as they did when they first came 	2.7354238644515463
if it must be so , it must 	3.913116244421226
" good heaven ! what is to become of us ! what are we to do ! " would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe 	2.3623187664921494
such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her , and she began her song 	3.838023149897459
i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy 	3.0017251241868723
her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances , and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men 	2.8670958065618217
and on their being seated , a pause , awkward as such pauses must always be , succeeded for a few moments 	2.3795611985602556
" " perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson 	2.4774483413753265
and , after a pause of several minutes , was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion , who , in a manner , which though it spoke compassion , spoke likewise restraint , said , " i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern 	2.4436728208423397
" " that is very strange 	2.9398744027401547
<num>	4.24676143746824
she talked on , therefore , without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins , who entered with an air more stately than usual , and on perceiving whom , she said to the girls , " now , i do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together 	3.0185117894777536
i will only add , god bless you 	2.539611984992537
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband 	2.272354758120201
" i do not get on at all 	2.9857037260510126
" away ran the girls , too eager to get in to have time for speech 	2.3255317002905063
" while mary is adjusting her ideas , " he continued , " let us return to mr bingley 	2.8674854366602345
he was well , but so much engaged with mr darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him 	3.380611784899067
the garden sloping to the road , the house standing in it , the green pales and the laurel hedge , every thing declared they were arriving 	4.2910125552897895
she did not fear her father ' s opposition , but he was going to be made unhappy , and that it should be through her means , that she , his favourite child , should be distressing him by her choice , should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her , was a wretched reflection , and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again , when , looking at him , she was a little relieved by his smile 	2.84999327701789
" " my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents 	2.2611053816493114
but since then , we have both , i hope , improved in civility 	2.8076489884014695
it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society , a persuasion which of course recommended him still more 	2.2487160121540732
the compliment must be all for herself 	3.0653593977655187
but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend 	2.514781445561495
you may depend upon my seeking no further 	2.6692329845106557
this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view 	2.1627561167500775
" " to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either 	2.240572722082126
" mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt , and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description , when mr hurst called them to order , with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward 	2.19208739061888
after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject , mr bennet coolly observed , " from all that i can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country 	2.9286530693074084
i will have no reserves from you 	3.151133504272716
he replied , and was again silent 	4.547578237253174
they talked of his sister , his friends , his house , his fruit , of every thing but himself 	3.472578531829475
" elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself , and said to colonel fitzwilliam , " your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word i say 	2.696172978139773
when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance , and courting the good opinion of people , with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace 	2.761569226207784
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper , or her affectionate heart 	2.700684029177162
it is mr wickham ' s intention to go into the regulars 	3.1556561318686986
and on these occasions , mrs gardiner , rendered suspicious by elizabeth ' s warm commendation of him , narrowly observed them both 	2.833835822516944
indeed , you must have seen it in the papers 	4.372220176381389
but of course she did not mention my name to you 	3.2113106515894407
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence , which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad 	2.0645491496708503
" 'tis too much ! " she added , " by far too much 	3.087692800858486
" she sat intently at work , striving to be composed , and without daring to lift up her eyes , till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister , as the servant was approaching the door 	2.682064364513589
though her manner varied however , her determination never did 	2.426454686422592
mr collins then returned to elizabeth 	2.9666122241842627
" nay , " said elizabeth , " this is not fair 	4.209668056226332
and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it 	2.9541510090060266
my aunt ' s intelligence had given me hope , and i was determined at once to know every thing 	2.9573341870220657
but with him i believe it does not often happen 	3.270292709407669
when is your turn to come ? you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane 	2.6898918001056034
but his pride , his abominable pride , his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane , his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging , though he could not justify it , and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham , his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny , soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited 	2.6848035196238507
it was exactly a scene , and exactly among people , where he had apparently least to do , and least temptation to go 	2.4285733813073254
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage , it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew 	2.6986015028066386
hart was the originator of the project gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone 	3.076356072687902
bingley urged mr jones ' s being sent for immediately 	2.7908171121183063
i have a warm , unguarded temper , and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him , and to him , too freely 	3.3050341719301266
do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will 	2.703043018603068
mrs reynolds , either from pride or attachment , had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister 	2.432390845511593
i fancy , lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all 	2.844701878164348
you are charmingly group'd , and appear to uncommon advantage 	4.178726998932128
she directly replied , " you need not be frightened 	4.029744182403354
" " well , my dear , " said mr bennet , when elizabeth had read the note aloud , " if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley , and under your orders 	3.1617120315285066
" " perhaps that is not possible for any one 	2.8410680064057043
" miss bingley , however , was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in any thing , and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives 	3.11013049993379
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting , that had she chosen it , she might by this time have been presented to her , as her future niece 	3.1030432775307495
i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to 	2.084076700835077
" but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation , she made no answer 	2.4338125405176174
he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former 	2.3658198979000566
and for the first evening she was his settled choice 	2.8176413599316645
she is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother 	4.426854329682888
and indeed i am quite of your opinion 	3.241487714718902
lady catherine , sir william , and mr and mrs collins sat down to quadrille 	3.373781978523379
as soon as they entered , bingley looked at her so expressively , and shook hands with such warmth , as left no doubt of his good information 	2.871077449911443
which are naturally lively enough 	3.14003228641075
stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all 	2.49896272314175
it is because he will not give himself the trouble 	2.694844208991739
the house , furniture , neighbourhood , and roads , were all to her taste , and lady catherine ' s behaviour was most friendly and obliging 	3.4048947429722785
but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother ' s permission for this address 	3.2421248988258826
it does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours 	2.2619622816310727
see <url> transcriber ' s note : text enclosed by underscores is in italics ( italics )	3.169599483244397
and from this time mr bingley ' s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them 	2.810748765930364
the little gardiners , attracted by the sight of a chaise , were standing on the steps of the house , as they entered the paddock 	2.7825471119698544
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed , by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking 	2.655849894753015
" but it is fortunate , " thought she , " that i have something to wish for 	3.0896831454825473
as soon as jane had read mr gardiner ' s hope of lydia ' s being soon married , her joy burst forth , and every following sentence added to its exuberance 	2.5988585347399957
<num>	4.24676143746824
" when my eyes were opened to his real character 	2.645311108068587
" and after an awkward pause , they returned to the rest of the family 	2.7657905060748824
" " you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which i have never acknowledged 	2.4255052638823895
but , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving , of your sister ' s indifference 	2.5856192574832977
but that is one great difference between us 	2.766559344699964
i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat 	3.0185434019177055
if you received the work electronically , the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund 	2.387502620481053
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known 	2.4805297632364645
" " in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure , " said bingley 	3.1921362563671143
after breakfast , the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham were returned , and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball 	2.570091179605069
and after all , mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance 	2.527218899687079
and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement 	2.739352981442202
for when supper was over , singing was talked of , and she had the mortification of seeing mary , after very little entreaty , preparing to oblige the company 	2.5324808201206777
adding , with a significant smile , " i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here 	2.8570809791446825
" " unless where they like women of fortune , which i think they very often do 	2.532761047910725
the prospect of such delights was very cheering , and they parted in mutual good spirits 	3.7918710992032834
how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one ' s own daughters i cannot understand 	2.2831412971848284
" nothing that she could say , however , had any influence 	3.935297169697151
" about a month ago i received this letter , and about a fortnight ago i answered it , for i thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention 	2.2435745448873985
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget , as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me 	2.409562983045933
and , after receiving her answer , asked in an hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there 	2.4546431246358593
" " obstinate , headstrong girl ! i am ashamed of you ! is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? is nothing due to me on that score ? " let us sit down 	2.019346787427943
whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable 	4.517115854570513
" kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room 	2.3865706325527216
" yes , ma'am , that he was indeed 	4.346089971945842
a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern 	2.7909570458221777
mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter , and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible 	3.1941256178394415
after a short silence , the lady first spoke 	2.8899540628862868
but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters ? mr bingley will not be detained in london by them 	2.020336920314074
" i never heard any thing so abominable 	3.040685378680609
though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it , before they did 	2.8650882230087236
" " we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , " said elizabeth 	2.3669843398726798
but we considered it , we talked of it as impossible 	2.775933341892099
bingley was every thing that was charming , except the professed lover of her daughter 	2.60615577675421
" her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption , while the servants remained 	2.41308175657584
that he was not a good tempered man , had been her firmest opinion 	3.598000527524364
" but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine 	2.5268977075948853
from his garden , mr collins would have led them round his two meadows , but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost , turned back 	2.3387730538657583
interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other 	2.9436766134985137
steady to his purpose , he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday , and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour , he adhered most conscientiously to his book , and would not even look at her 	2.633400275916873
i could see him with perfect indifference , but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of 	2.967500725199443
but jane was to go home with her , and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation 	2.967936423334328
and then , though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate , she began to regret that he came 	2.9230999280648824
miss bingley ' s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcy ' s progress through his book , as in reading her own 	2.6185121613162843
" " what is it you mean ? " " it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady ' s family , it would be an unpleasant thing 	2.679845454294573
i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn 	2.541186553465746
they were of course all intending to be surprised 	2.839545127363465
will you come and see me ? " " we shall often meet , i hope , in hertfordshire 	3.0750950897097544
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth 	3.1086156902813293
i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh , and of her mother lady catherine 	3.1246732325121784
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy ' s marriage 	3.089933476774745
and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again , whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them 	2.2279223434179394
the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people ! what would i give to hear your strictures on them ! " " your conjecture is totally wrong , i assure you 	2.3627646495243915
elizabeth was excessively disappointed 	3.2291273818004225
they shook hands with great cordiality 	3.1026796488907338
or , with a mind so occupied , she might have forgotten where she was 	3.0083617995466336
" my dear , dear aunt , " she rapturously cried , " what delight ! what felicity ! you give me fresh life and vigour 	2.7150394617702633
lydia does not leave me because she is married 	2.7305234841729544
" " you make me laugh , charlotte 	2.605337376889637
" yet why did he come ? " she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself 	2.885852499271619
i have faults enough , but they are not , i hope , of understanding 	2.8575611340081144
elizabeth , feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation , now put herself forward to confirm his account , by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself 	2.2478441614159728
" " you have 	3.510672698856957
they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation 	2.16677116308439
there is nothing in that 	3.548081609133934
mr collins ' s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete 	2.8284032371224805
" you write uncommonly fast 	3.05735578301294
it was reasonable , however , to hope , that they would not continue long 	3.7650595593225273
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence 	2.537687486998067
and if he had the fortune he ought to have , i should think you could not do better 	3.5211662429304758
but on returning to the drawing room , when her letter was finished , she saw , to her infinite surprise , there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her 	2.7450668261493485
" the period of expectation was now doubled 	2.9646232259621326
" and that i suppose is one of your sisters 	3.3302153723925545
and pride has often been his best friend 	2.7644630049577597
" " can you possibly guess , lizzy , who is meant by this ? " " this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire , splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage 	2.357689543232285
for a few minutes he was silent 	3.2537215202557515
mrs reynolds could interest her on no other point 	2.4839266461849343
if she heard me , it was by good luck , for i am sure she did not listen 	3.719931532702546
lydia laughed , and said , " aye , that is just like your formality and discretion 	3.0489875094528966
had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle , she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself 	2.35857367167678
on sunday , after morning service , the separation , so agreeable to almost all , took place 	2.2237088306421793
" mrs collins , you must send a servant with them 	3.436606466373176
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory 	3.7290874587129674
at his own house especially , and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do 	2.7027172062825464
as for elizabeth , her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last 	2.678796756303043
<num>	4.24676143746824
you know i have 	3.6291207739735576
but that gentleman , " looking at darcy , " seemed to think the country was nothing at all 	2.580161723014536
and all three being actuated by one spirit , every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled 	2.4281800493515457
after sitting for a moment in silence , she said very stiffly to elizabeth , " i hope you are well , miss bennet 	3.6144763116270466
" " and what did she say ? " " that you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had not turned out well 	2.8000022741855775
and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared 	2.6994000656623167
allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear miss eliza , ( glancing at her sister and bingley , ) shall take place 	2.6769358577582203
but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us , if i had not perceived , by jane ' s letter last wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what i now tell you , can give you no fresh pain 	2.544703903121403
elizabeth listened with delight to the happy , though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley ' s regard , and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it 	2.838894145188627
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side 	3.418827715537068
" your examination of mr darcy is over , i presume , " said miss bingley 	3.4926274284482814
" it must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year 	2.623323012366417
" they were all astonished 	3.8444061176660176
elizabeth had received none since her return , that could come from pemberley 	2.6546085859556894
and in this early example of what lydia ' s infamy must produce , found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business 	2.508060373412059
the next morning , however , made an alteration 	3.5575507691069226
we have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady catherine de bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye 	2.576637453307203
and if you persist in indifference , do not make me your confidante 	3.18781702064591
nor did that day wear out her resentment 	2.660742990138027
but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger 	2.4508514130719856
she was confident of having performed her duty , and to fret over unavoidable evils , or augment them by anxiety , was no part of her disposition 	2.5436139116819136
" " indeed ! " cried wickham with a look which did not escape her 	2.6611854627575653
elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady ' s attention , which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others 	2.486520214055018
mr collins , awkward and solemn , apologising instead of attending , and often moving wrong without being aware of it , gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give 	2.06523406016323
and that friendship between a person capable of it , and such an amiable man as mr bingley , was incomprehensible 	3.257612113581846
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility , but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening , although utterly unknown to her before 	2.6154140655197113
elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her 	2.4222780090309546
people did say , you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas 	2.6346299789341354
the envelope itself was likewise full 	2.855399575251874
could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to colonel forster ? his temptation is not adequate to the risk 	2.2947063135728913
jane had been a week in town , without either seeing or hearing from caroline 	2.7789794270459374
and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is 	2.7889989254022427
i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this , and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished 	2.9625381719553263
with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say , she began his account of what had happened at netherfield 	2.452961375512868
having been frequently in company with him since her return , agitation was pretty well over 	2.3338367096811052
but in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable 	2.689884840741357
the least agreeable circumstance in the business , was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet , whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person 	2.295899902774737
" mr darcy took her advice , and did finish his letter 	2.4443350688431162
" " much more rational , my dear caroline , i dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball 	2.8546316191049095
but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish 	2.637225387991261
long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided 	2.665645432953541
and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him 	2.447161435970853
and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go , she did not seem to ask for compassion 	2.782207285520312
u 	5.742573944199342
" " i desire you will do no such thing 	2.500466257042705
mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer , and forced his younger sister to be civil also , and say what the occasion required 	2.373630533937923
" " you mistake me , my dear 	3.0118635724865235
well ! i am so happy 	4.315057924717739
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered , a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening 	2.082474672742279
why should they not go on to scotland , if that had been the case ? " " in the first place , " replied mr gardiner , " there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland 	2.992959045663514
<num>	4.24676143746824
i rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen 	2.700049081342022
and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave , than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs 	2.2486925725377716
she was wild to be at home to hear , to see , to be upon the spot , to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her , in a family so deranged 	2.835939459999762
but her own opinion continued the same , and she left him disappointed and sorry 	2.875958323977002
and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair 	2.52671899122629
when at length they arose to take leave , mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn 	2.550409401601263
but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle 	2.3339200256219192
and then rising up , said to elizabeth , " miss bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn 	3.1787700255050706
and will probably be much talked of 	2.9267494392579274
elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes 	2.8341657015279087
jane looked a little paler than usual , but more sedate than elizabeth had expected 	3.1667521735096185
" elizabeth almost stared at her 	2.8290197798589682
it was hardly enough 	3.2842351914935217
mr bingley was good looking and gentleman like 	2.680077528235625
" " for heaven ' s sake , madam , speak lower 	2.725720746440559
thirdly , she trusted that they would never be happy together 	3.3400643825708975
that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly 	2.6828532522576904
" mr darcy ' s letter to lady catherine , was in a different style 	3.601533906138274
they are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line 	2.9377092093599124
to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying 	2.644116782286496
indeed , mr darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear 	2.6934134930805547
" her aunt assured her that she was 	3.7208965637779037
had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? " as she pronounced these words , mr darcy changed colour 	2.5860411861186043
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw 	2.6573955189279124
i do not know what to say to you 	3.3552217971499285
he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear 	3.156465437735386
give my love to colonel forster , i hope you will drink to our good journey 	2.7438780543958448
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity 	3.263124542273043
here , sarah , come to miss bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown 	2.9094505290075294
and the pleasure of being with charlotte , and the kind attentions she had received , must make her feel the obliged 	2.946046207291521
oh ! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance ! " " oh ! my dear , " continued mrs bennet , " i am quite delighted with him 	3.9378452824676713
" " yes , vanity is a weakness indeed 	2.466508252464411
but who was your mother ? who are your uncles and aunts ? do not imagine me ignorant of their condition 	2.673102964748766
he sat with them above an hour , and was in remarkably good spirits 	3.17234704299139
i talked about the dance , and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples 	2.8387606082630787
and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity 	2.4772855746815985
" " my dear sir , " replied mr collins , " i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship ' s concurrence 	3.0536040156557545
miss bingley ' s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy , and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps 	2.951480221837254
on this subject i have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer 	3.2698735230796885
her features , though not plain , were insignificant 	3.3140626853368156
" " i can readily believe , " answered he gravely , " that report may vary greatly with respect to me 	2.336392335136852
" " you cannot be too much on your guard 	2.9250664621892875
their sister ' s wedding day arrived 	3.6441797944855376
and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day 	2.409398485493896
the two first dances , however , brought a return of distress 	2.9262974713675103
thank heaven ! i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him 	2.481839756594415
your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct , i am sure 	2.7287535626256667
i am not qualified to form one 	2.919259707516402
" now i am quite happy , " said she , " for you will be as happy as myself 	3.3620935708852047
she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent 	2.6168503437503357
she could not win him , however , to any conversation 	4.411499587651062
the day passed much as the day before had done 	3.02000065818119
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family , the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night 	2.377937932076846
the pause was to elizabeth ' s feelings dreadful 	3.577249604057901
but he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not 	2.685421317968333
after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event , which elizabeth considered as all but certain , and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible 	2.2323870647410535
" i am very glad to hear such a good account of her , " said lady catherine 	3.349963632189808
i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be 	3.503806706521704
" i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! " cried jane 	2.7406434005383655
" " and men take care that they should 	2.7818919654618046
" and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother ? " said mr gardiner 	3.2810304991893164
by tea time however the dose had been enough , and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again , and when tea was over , glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies 	2.7435994957064755
" " certainly , " replied elizabeth " there are such people , but i hope i am not one of them 	3.307508210212208
" " i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these 	2.125011520202629
" what could he mean ? she was dying to know what could be his meaning " and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ? " not at all , " was her answer 	2.292152453942144
he had never before supposed that , could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter , it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself , as by the present arrangement 	2.516648245498491
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party 	2.4066113398306452
and hastily seizing a sheet of paper , wrote a short letter to her aunt , to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt , if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended 	2.3964962135233363
and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia ' s leaving home 	3.2688249058267465
his words seemed to imply it 	3.3019890167691384
elizabeth took up some needlework , and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion 	2.8981944843906415
she had ventured only one glance at darcy 	2.614753759927444
" i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family 	2.7279729533237225
volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg tm ' s goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come 	2.5470353075291556
" as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue , she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley , and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to , made her perhaps almost as happy as jane 	2.638156190901691
she was shewn into the breakfast parlour , where all but jane were assembled , and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise 	2.3429595460589816
not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body 	2.834353866477742
her own thoughts were employing her 	3.181279249259914
he spoke well , but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed , and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride 	3.410616062187981
" and certainly ought not to have appeared 	2.9992233469541385
<num>	4.24676143746824
i believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as i wished it in reason 	2.325477969425234
she will be down in a moment i dare say 	3.6524992063987707
" " beyond a doubt , they do wish him to chuse miss darcy , " replied jane 	3.0501565425877075
" excuse my interference 	3.35428196228619
and know them to be so much attached to me ! they were excessively sorry to go ! but so they always are 	2.4354779968562643
and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise , and owned she encouraged it as much as possible 	2.437420360179334
mr gardiner was a sensible , gentleman like man , greatly superior to his sister , as well by nature as education 	2.680674250433817
" " no , i thank you 	2.944376688120562
but this would be nothing if you really liked him 	2.647694628884021
i knew it myself , as it was known to miss bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it 	2.8129507395999926
the letter was to this effect : " my dear lizzy , " i wish you joy 	3.851020789255011
sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man 	2.44437206853129
yet she received them with tolerable ease , and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment , or any unnecessary complaisance 	2.3858578059039215
they insist also on my seeing mr jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and head ache there is not much the matter with me 	2.316964865231817
he and his sisters were well , i hope , when you left london 	3.9345347380248357
their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge 	2.698396901783239
he walked away again immediately , and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind 	2.7872559690022873
she remembered its warmth , and softened its impropriety of expression 	2.2513513302216634
i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park 	2.825482200907319
the favour of your company has been much felt , i assure you 	2.511837685067277
i wonder what he can be doing there 	2.8680729911620384
he seemed scarcely to hear her , and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation 	3.0208766015916555
you will have a charming mother in law , indeed , and of course she will be always at pemberley with you 	3.2534763259466337
mr hurst had therefore nothing to do , but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep 	3.458619175639221
they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world 	3.6951236356197064
to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where , and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with 	2.440566830062521
it could not be for society , as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips 	2.5810536927212264
did you admire me for my impertinence ? " " for the liveliness of your mind , i did 	3.480103160775776
if you received the work on a physical medium , you must return the medium with your written explanation 	2.510220312059282
it is a nice long walk , and mr darcy has never seen the view 	3.086900941529401
but if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself 	2.8194657570249357
stay where you are 	3.6703175857035264
some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages 	2.464650137800713
but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion , suffered no variation of colour 	2.5586297353618717
follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies do divert me , i own , and i laugh at them whenever i can 	3.4512820458794398
she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham , and rejoiced in it 	3.6362325818216163
and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride 	3.149984212277768
no aunt , no officers , no news could be sought after 	2.3463947657413797
on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls , whose eagerness for their cousin ' s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room , and whose shyness , as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth , prevented their coming lower 	2.6437334739488247
i can remember no symptom of affection on either side 	2.4248265843366306
but you know married women have never much time for writing 	2.3267601348197315
these were the contents : " my dear harriet , " you will laugh when you know where i am gone , and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning , as soon as i am missed 	2.7820100493900295
lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before , how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live 	2.4102428221104817
poor lydia ' s situation must , at best , be bad enough 	3.1225869950435268
" " you are all kindness , madam 	2.7755067692965416
and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted , and forwarded , as much as possible , every attempt at conversation on either side 	3.124142585344657
" " yes 	2.6895785044543086
" " oh , no ! " said elizabeth 	3.0725559037171517
" if one could but go to brighton ! " observed mrs bennet 	2.3279429760256085
and on the part of mrs bennet and kitty , though she was perfectly unknown to them , even inferior to what elizabeth felt 	3.061168591170482
it was all over before i arrived 	2.9212545119409254
and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn , nothing remained to be done but to go 	2.3089597305617886
but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject 	2.5599634538923697
but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything 	2.2405886210297563
a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away 	2.833952077836322
and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock 	2.465224820330238
in pompous nothings on his side , and civil assents on that of his cousins , their time passed till they entered meryton 	2.7270338795314304
my sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother ' s nephew , colonel fitzwilliam , and myself 	3.414081637906541
elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene , and could observe the three ladies before her composedly 	2.4370893060503764
but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham 	2.409450273621549
there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home , how she would like lady catherine , and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be 	2.6262507047393506
but her mind was so busily engaged , that she did not always know when she was silent 	3.363354992908444
at present , indeed , they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood 	2.4373246834653868
" your friend performs delightfully 	3.1535567196617835
and such i might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest elizabeth ! what do i not owe you ! you taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous 	2.2411153120732994
you tear them to pieces 	4.020597927234574
elizabeth did all she could , to shield him from the frequent notice of either , and was ever anxious to keep him to herself , and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification 	3.0523041653731284
and mary , at the end of a long concerto , was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs , at the request of her younger sisters , who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room 	2.699391503431072
it is unaccountable ! in every view it is unaccountable ! " " my dear lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these 	2.95577892595663
i shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer 	2.167009525521244
there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again 	3.1013095719666186
these recollections will not do at all 	3.3053279293900526
by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure 	2.959513640243158
" jane ' s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall 	2.5474025264543707
and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present , the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness 	3.023494271761826
" " neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , " replied elizabeth , " have any possible claim on me , in the present instance 	2.6913586935716873
" chapter xiii 	3.1865771584191465
elizabeth , easy and unaffected , had been listened to with much more pleasure , though not playing half so well 	2.5198009801885117
" " i have already told her so once , by your desire 	2.5262100392599023
and as dawson does not object to the barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , i should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large 	2.9369045539384793
it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling 	2.4544585236320677
till i can forget his father , i can never defy or expose him 	2.8692264076704537
that the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , i shall not attempt to deny 	2.7886992188823023
i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you 	3.3428951314676185
she has never been taught to think on serious subjects 	2.391949217645263
" mary wished to say something very sensible , but knew not how 	2.7934018086596715
nothing could console and nothing appease her 	2.8540527130753537
any alternate format must include the full project gutenberg tm license as specified in paragraph <num>	2.584142328319824
" but how did he account for it ? " " it must have been his sister ' s doing 	3.529286972626309
i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible 	2.5122014689280068
and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes 	3.052215782906343
" she then sat still five minutes longer 	2.6283475381123873
and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected 	2.902171277905703
i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford 	2.397239838415479
" when i consider , " she added , in a yet more agitated voice , " that i might have prevented it ! i who knew what he was 	2.9611887003845085
oh ! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! " wickham , lydia , were all forgotten 	2.5222478031069695
but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded 	2.843074143534584
the carriage was sent to meet them at , and they were to return in it , by dinner time 	3.3667838853049683
most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman ' s education 	3.3148262688336487
" " not at all , " he replied 	3.636633493377228
but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt 	2.7489420212361906
i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude 	2.9448748260402833
it was unpardonable 	3.7228739643278543
and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them 	2.3921131195329766
it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her 	2.405458189940679
i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places 	2.754707454212423
" of music ! then pray speak aloud 	2.5952453694160478
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning 	3.2031045464695587
i have by no means done 	3.653206959991108
though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , i instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that i might make my sentiments known to you 	2.7277172407337895
" " had you then persuaded yourself that i should ? " " indeed i had 	3.014442226737564
but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation 	2.7227760194360497
stay , stay , i will go myself 	3.7896914113013436
but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing , and between herself and elizabeth , therefore , the subject was never alluded to 	3.1692817799406012
" elizabeth answered only by a slight bow 	2.8778230455417515
" and accordingly she did turn , and they walked towards the parsonage together 	2.7428567475354337
its completion depended on others 	3.1874210768793994
and then was enraged against herself for being so silly ! " a man who has once been refused ! how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings ! " she was a little revived , however , by his bringing back his coffee cup himself 	2.283028089091746
" " and this is your real opinion ! this is your final resolve ! very well 	2.487812707069366
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it 	2.6790939217939767
but here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister ' s absence , i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized 	2.488235528377984
and that made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter 	2.63826696305571
after watching her a little , fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful 	2.698976127371205
" " the letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so 	3.0226397148175823
and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , i will take it on myself 	2.8000492376987256
and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her , she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both , and could very sincerely wish him happy 	2.4548369373427263
with a renewal of tenderness , however , they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour , and sat with her till summoned to coffee 	2.7697154081292217
but the latter half , which was dated a day later , and written in evident agitation , gave more important intelligence 	2.2509721504057354
" indeed , you are mistaken , madam 	3.693437066706596
london : printed for t 	2.3855035427292264
but without much success 	3.4902676610202055
whichever were the case , though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference , her sister ' s situation remained the same , her peace equally wounded 	2.8046231342651025
perhaps that was the reason of his silence 	3.4485096700802718
" " if your master would marry , you might see more of him 	2.398845553603306
we have certainly done our best 	2.91360420622146
miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house 	2.8992018675222098
but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up 	2.7284495368410675
tell him what a dreadful state i am in , that i am frightened out of my wits 	3.07226171428585
" " ah ! sir , i do indeed 	3.0403082470273834
and continually was she repeating , " why is he so altered ? from what can it proceed ? it cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened 	2.2118262483683235
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other 	2.4006326603493564
and though mrs collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as i have often told her , to come to rosings every day , and play on the piano forte in mrs jenkinson ' s room 	2.567231936185893
but if you are really innocent and ignorant , i must be more explicit 	3.331342620513887
had elizabeth ' s opinion been all drawn from her own family , she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort 	2.691940965777391
she now lost every expectation of pleasure 	2.8430037919403075
he had certainly formed such a plan , and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet , it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend 	2.3494684476239103
for mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law , that she ventured not to speak to him , unless it was in her power to offer him any attention , or mark her deference for his opinion 	2.4144363932922674
" " that is very true , " replied elizabeth , " and i could easily forgive his pride , if he had not mortified mine 	3.0359039912037864
she put down the letter , weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success 	3.101730058884405
i am a gentleman ' s daughter 	3.097695231813224
in ran mrs bennet to her daughter ' s room , in her dressing gown , and with her hair half finished , crying out , " my dear jane , make haste and hurry down 	2.7500964696997294
she answered in the affirmative , and , unable to resist the temptation , added , " when you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance 	2.8302863718400806
all loveliness and goodness as she is ! her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating 	2.612190928893142
we have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which i hope you will approve 	2.606890092965819
and added , that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage 	2.606584074413493
is it true ? " elizabeth replied that it was 	3.7828873588330385
it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner 	2.8400101805620053
you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you 	2.7172236611170484
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house 	2.5983331416835074
or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent ' s mind 	2.8089172945750307
mrs bennet was quite disconcerted 	3.260428564933896
the colour which had been driven from her face , returned for half a minute with an additional glow , and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes , as she thought for that space of time , that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken 	2.6559157888764795
and that being the case , i cannot consider your situation with much compassion 	2.731660632558585
" " oh ! no it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy 	2.7298133909257065
and , though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy ' s father , five years before , it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends , than she had been in the way of procuring 	2.83077751601645
mr darcy ' s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict , gave her a keener sense of her sister ' s sufferings 	3.4834902388042055
" chapter iv 	3.1865771584191465
and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her ' s , it was performed in a proper manner , without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary 	2.6099621583779666
make haste , and come down this moment 	2.595353619635194
mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure , but as his brother was eager in it , he meant to assist him in pursuing it 	2.4096047702711663
" " my mother would have had no objection , but my father hates london 	2.8701495327237883
so far each recital confirmed the other : but when she came to the will , the difference was great 	2.3950403579519794
jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening 	2.102733458077559
i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner 	3.0519912133292504
i cannot acquit him of that duty 	3.097600922230725
he really believed , that were it not for the inferiority of her connections , he should be in some danger 	2.420758555620132
" it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man 	3.1829407194791575
two obstacles of the five being thus removed , mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time , without making any impression on them 	2.4734614081406785
let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them 	2.5793432121531636
she certainly did not hate him 	2.867300582083889
" " i can much more easily believe mr bingley ' s being imposed on , than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night 	2.52166024174698
and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there , to know the rest 	2.5670046181325827
but i must write no more 	3.2548400127675254
their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers , and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed , or a really new muslin in a shop window , could recal them 	2.300493008025075
so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him ! he walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! not handsome enough to dance with ! i wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs 	2.50043133130337
but i am sure i never saw any thing of it 	3.4208877811496303
pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , i have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned 	2.6879613685321684
he had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go 	2.6094347350331253
for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for i ought not to have mentioned the subject ? this will never do 	2.465998718898963
but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every body ' s character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone 	2.5733247617178825
" " i believe her to be both in a great degree , " replied wickham 	2.835132272035883
mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue , and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves 	2.452505136868911
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat , cake , and a variety of all the finest fruits in season 	3.1508765171688946
" mrs reynolds ' s respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master 	2.5444792725072185
she could see him instantly before her , in every charm of air and address 	2.8553832767591456
it is what every body says 	3.3059712856955614
one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just 	2.5060861929814946
the evening passed quietly , unmarked by any thing extraordinary 	3.2099050323260596
it should not be said , that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers 	3.528362150944937
" elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ' s praise 	3.1610441156478792
" he replied , " and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled 	3.64740606563337
" you may well be surprised , miss bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday 	2.3677673310804828
" elizabeth made no objection 	2.9976825524318182
miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte , and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way , which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived , she seated herself 	2.2534245525086223
it was absolutely necessary , therefore , to think of something , and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire , and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure , she observed , " how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november , mr darcy ! it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon 	2.815268842219277
you must feel it 	3.748232667363664
" " lizzy , " said her father , " i have given him my consent 	3.766070692505169
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others 	2.7946020350699077
till the next morning , however , she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance 	3.7150767574185486
i speak feelingly 	4.142205612179005
but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly 	2.751970830439201
i knew how it would be 	3.8989897253671373
though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm , at her lively , sportive , manner of talking to her brother 	2.4701586253894448
i never was 	3.8635624792758203
they had often attempted it before , but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason 	3.016009601906153
and of late it has been shifting about pretty much 	3.0456180756143967
" the idea of mr collins , with all his solemn composure , being run away with by his feelings , made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther , and he continued : " my reasons for marrying are , first , that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish 	2.237127535237293
she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times 	2.5906763563852575
and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long , that even bingley ' s good humour was overcome , and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone 	2.3924310440086405
mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister , that they did not once sit down to a family dinner 	2.637652729434435
people do not die of little trifling colds 	2.6115002854358247
mrs bennet was doubly engaged , on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane , who sat some way below her , and on the other , retailing them all to the younger miss lucases 	2.891709999393119
gregory b 	4.445399867693924
she had instinctively turned away 	3.838598565396634
the evening conversation , when they were all assembled , had lost much of its animation , and almost all its sense , by the absence of jane and elizabeth 	2.610246543126642
i know we dine with four and twenty families 	2.429149772796876
and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource , if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family , were unfavourably answered 	3.0783536933586673
" " may we take my uncle ' s letter to read to her ? " " take whatever you like , and get away 	2.5201989939015217
about the middle of the next day , as she was in her room getting ready for a walk , a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion 	2.7309383041870814
miss darcy , the daughter of mr darcy , of pemberley , and lady anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner 	3.0448130753461524
your name will never even be mentioned by any of us 	2.7392236905692227
and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion 	2.9088255268661523
" " mr darcy ! " repeated elizabeth , in utter amazement 	3.03318545905072
when mr bennet wrote again to his brother , therefore , he sent his permission for them to come 	2.789845498824809
" elizabeth felt herself completely taken in 	2.681180271340183
" elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact 	2.69725382370394
and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them , he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing , and called out to her , " my dear miss eliza , why are not you dancing ? mr darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner 	2.8068798809008464
no , i certainly am not 	3.8209957005077713
i will try again 	3.5905882132593074
i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure 	2.155378975568374
" what do you mean , mr bennet , by talking in this way ? you promised me to insist upon her marrying him 	2.448111862898705
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well 	3.4508167790481967
" chapter xiii 	3.1865771584191465
mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect , that the sight of such rooms , so many servants , and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them 	2.5165997892617455
these bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had i with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination 	2.872912054338146
" oh ! yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen 	2.524769637140294
charlotte tried to console her 	3.205181017807932
you have no compassion on my poor nerves 	3.0170130479119655
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified 	2.8093894018711363
if his own vanity , however , did not mislead him , he was the cause , his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered , and still continued to suffer 	3.1042861797659516
no man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it 	2.6695034100543245
happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance 	2.734447103572152
jane was not happy 	3.5300639062751866
and if i had my will , we should 	2.956330275329384
" " do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? " " it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it 	2.860382979498225
for though elated by his rank , it did not render him supercilious 	2.8238795615530328
and she could do nothing but think , and think with wonder , of mr darcy ' s civility , and above all , of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister 	2.665680255209695
she is not such a simpleton 	3.561236976264521
" said her mother as soon as she was in the hall 	4.167352036266543
to fortune i am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since i am well aware that it could not be complied with 	2.2780312424152993
and it grew so much worse towards the evening that , added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy , it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings , where they were engaged to drink tea 	2.257180589527717
they had , therefore , many acquaintance in common 	3.2059184401391247
well , any friend of mr bingley ' s will always be welcome here to be sure 	2.834858528653376
how he lived i know not 	3.313508500622457
the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all <num> states of the united states 	2.689283415961225
one must speak a little , you know 	3.2493857579799306
and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls 	3.2142333274709802
something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them , but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life 	2.602920226189098
elizabeth , to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this , heard it in silent indignation 	2.8446965793045087
but , though this might be imaginary , she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy , who had been set up as a rival of jane 	3.393489126517531
you will be a very happy woman 	3.956464282098127
that tall , proud man 	3.054205144063508
chapter vii 	3.795770813013684
there ' s for you ! she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool 	2.6816295005629347
it was really attentive 	3.4257897795887837
in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage 	2.925883049277722
" " let me write for you , " said jane , " if you dislike the trouble yourself 	3.076983854421768
" " exceed their income ! my dear mr bennet , " cried his wife , " what are you talking of ? why , he has four or five thousand a year , and very likely more 	2.6250880846892413
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern , and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away , just as they were all getting so intimate together 	2.6343548827036933
once or twice she could discern a faint blush 	3.4595661892619383
the gentlemen arrived early 	3.453031587868328
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew ' s letter , that charlotte , really rejoicing in the match , was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over 	2.604240875105652
" " your coming to longbourn , to see me and my family , " said elizabeth , coolly , " will be rather a confirmation of it 	2.8302395302890293
mr wickham , after a few moments , touched his hat a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return 	2.5769770529722797
that it should be equally unreserved was impossible 	3.2222704052451463
and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual , and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation 	2.7848604669484676
from something that he told me in our journey hither , i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him 	2.5366356757533755
for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him 	2.7685637822320777
but to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult 	2.864952234598021
and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter 	2.2191065215040275
whence , in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander , were many charming views of the valley , the opposite hills , with the long range of woods overspreading many , and occasionally part of the stream 	2.524973118637042
in looking back to what they had feared , only two hours ago , she felt all the advantages of what they had gained 	2.646736352311472
the second began 	3.979663747157298
mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton 	2.6890811512494173
he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her 	3.3759336521065775
" darcy smiled and said , " you are perfectly right 	3.462101787445536
his revenge would have been complete indeed 	3.9250557206068835
their parties abroad were less varied than before 	2.531223955111825
i am not equal to it 	3.640674876894141
" you may readily comprehend , " she added , " what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time 	2.412996978157875
but in general charlotte wisely did not hear 	2.7444742757290466
his civility , therefore , was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk 	3.1398959396923045
and , my dear jane , i never saw you look in greater beauty 	3.435679116687931
" " i should like it beyond any thing ! " said her mother 	2.9662602117254377
my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them 	2.8126103956692416
" it was greatly my wish that he should do so , " he added , " as soon as his marriage was fixed on 	3.140030170543358
his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother ' s ear 	2.776873849290084
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case , unknown to the society of hertfordshire 	2.4535497073828902
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of , the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time , for from the day of the invitation , to the day of the ball , there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once 	2.7588113711360958
and considering mr collins ' s character , connections , and situation in life , i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state 	2.4155645874272116
this event had at last been despaired of , but it was then too late to be saving 	2.586876950716202
they met again on sunday , and then i saw him too 	3.2053250455218936
" " are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? " " both , " replied elizabeth archly 	2.691806189644509
it is from my cousin , mr collins , who , when i am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases 	3.025000189426904
i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought , nor their offences against myself 	2.5690033108033075
her astonishment , however , was extreme 	3.8940005562641473
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a scheme of infamy 	2.9982334559910107
she could neither wonder nor condemn , but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom , afforded no palliation of her distress 	3.2545878353201956
that proud and repulsive as were his manners , she had never , in the whole course of their acquaintance , an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together , and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways , seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits 	2.6029539207326224
do you draw ? " " no , not at all 	3.477454865556046
and when we got to the george , i do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too 	2.8119802807686636
and in spite of every thing , was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune 	2.84887211745858
" why , my dear , you must know , mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england 	2.5397596798399946
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man , and talked very pleasantly 	2.256933918412185
" " nor i , i am sure , " said miss bingley 	3.03217187453108
" elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character , but said nothing 	2.81216608164806
the other is charlotte ' s marriage 	3.352465305255198
you know my sentiments 	3.53731652665086
she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him 	2.6306473660673957
wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in london , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her 	2.8735954248675104
" from herself to jane from jane to bingley , her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcy ' s explanation there , had appeared very insufficient 	2.4595765417484166
they solaced their wretchedness , however , by duets after supper , while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister 	2.3769038876987776
i could hardly keep my countenance 	3.288678788697757
she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley 	2.5337520678182943
she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either , or make either appear to advantage 	2.1640830626199756
they may wish many things besides his happiness 	2.5320773017011953
nor was her respect for him , though it made her more quiet , at all likely to make her more elegant 	2.8307793691578786
her father had most cruelly mortified her , by what he said of mr darcy ' s indifference , and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration , or fear that perhaps , instead of his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much 	2.7044976355072223
there was one part especially , the opening of it , which i should dread your having the power of reading again 	2.637709999109895
at length the chaise arrived , the trunks were fastened on , the parcels placed within , and it was pronounced to be ready 	3.0069551085023045
she had always felt that charlotte ' s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own , but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action , she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage 	2.840585894296286
" to jane herself , " she exclaimed , " there could be no possibility of objection 	3.122304758365024
my father supported him at school , and afterwards at cambridge 	3.4362220747747023
in anticipating the happiness of bingley , which of course was to be inferior only to his own , he continued the conversation till they reached the house 	2.7353121516217227
i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more 	2.6982878924992955
the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which mr darcy could not have 	2.7071436710421546
and instantly embracing her , acknowledged , with the liveliest emotion , that she was the happiest creature in the world 	3.145249658937548
let me do it without farther loss of time 	2.772603527412819
with assumed tranquillity he then replied , " i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that i rejoice in my success 	2.9629301877539045
i wish i could see her 	3.266574788281924
mr darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me 	3.216826778367829
mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love 	2.2396439380830535
but he is a liberal master , i suppose , and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue 	2.876925611344037
" " i wish it may 	3.0328741843162366
and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance 	2.747194311992661
if he had been wavering before , as to what he should do , which had often seemed likely , the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt , and determine him at once to be as happy , as dignity unblemished could make him 	2.403336440310066
mr bennet indeed said little 	3.0660776637261002
" but if she is really headstrong and foolish , i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state 	2.2747691522645614
" " dear lizzy ! " " oh ! you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general 	3.3338860260949743
there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter , which promises well 	2.9606793813547774
but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine , tall person , handsome features , noble mien 	2.243218117853751
my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter ' s lips instead of your own 	2.2357610969188086
but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy 	2.5189864031600937
elizabeth ' s courage did not fail her 	2.8916203819129107
" " is this a hint to me , lizzy , " said her father , " to send for the horses ? " " no , indeed 	3.2367230372267177
and elizabeth sorry for her , and sorry for her father ' s speech , was afraid her anxiety had done no good 	2.7308952745034167
but his anger , i am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister ' s sentiments 	2.6778979741735225
and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications 	2.47551403815992
" " and so ended his affection , " said elizabeth impatiently 	3.1361444774931724
" " undoubtedly , " replied darcy , to whom this remark was chiefly addressed , " there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation 	2.9344898566261803
chapter i 	3.5825234165940225
" and though he exclaimed at the term , she found that it had been pretty much the case 	3.753199960862801
and mr bennet , who could by no means wish for so speedy a return , immediately said , " but is there not danger of lady catherine ' s disapprobation here , my good sir ? you had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness 	2.482291151115109
" darcy only smiled 	3.4348237134616384
there could not exist in the world two men , over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influence 	3.0273346542630595
" some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day , and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham , and give him an invitation also , if the family from longbourn would come in the evening 	2.8055928325199986
they could talk of nothing but officers 	3.121093939983885
she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened 	2.918138654672797
her ' s lasted a little longer 	3.2246944416221286
and at the age of twenty seven , without having ever been handsome , she felt all the good luck of it 	2.5027087004388435
but now she would no longer conceal from her , his share in lydia ' s marriage 	2.6464063558226503
she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingley ' s regard 	2.976198185882371
" to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply , and immediately and in silence withdrew 	2.1961099448978416
" his father was an excellent man , " said mrs gardiner 	3.1797735758923893
yours ever , " caroline bingley 	3.018171454305677
james ' s ? " " never , sir 	3.6125239818345394
in three volumes 	3.035429261304607
and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding 	3.5558758863965814
charlotte the wife of mr collins , was a most humiliating picture ! and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem , was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen 	2.6111820906869028
" i have an excessive regard for jane bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and i wish with all my heart she were well settled 	2.5230192626134604
" eliza bennet , " said miss bingley , when the door was closed on her , " is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own 	3.244625633258743
when they repaired to the dining room , elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place , which , in all their former parties , had belonged to him , by her sister 	2.644870107768761
but they did pass away , and mr and mrs gardiner , with their four children , did at length appear at longbourn 	2.497049323608609
and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage 	2.4339426189532407
kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas , for mr collins was only a clergyman 	3.1722969851845737
it was painful , exceedingly painful , to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return 	2.5215976513066747
" " good heavens ! " cried elizabeth 	3.125916956603262
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton 	2.656363961274251
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself 	3.005599824023203
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive 	2.7816453029011576
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham ' s departure , she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment 	2.715008768241375
they contained no actual complaint , nor was there any revival of past occurrences , or any communication of present suffering 	2.432038542057971
mr darcy corroborated it with a bow , and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth , when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger , and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other , was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting 	2.627318911275785
lydia has no brothers to step forward 	3.4508870205406845
and so fervently did she value his remembrance , and prefer him to every other man , that all her good sense , and all her attention to the feelings of her friends , were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets , which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity 	2.5892164186723394
" my dearest child , " she cried , " i can think of nothing else ! ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! 'tis as good as a lord ! and a special licence 	2.4268612610290687
can he be a sensible man , sir ? " " no , my dear 	3.31385120839524
" " yes 	2.6895785044543086
it was a large , well proportioned room , handsomely fitted up 	2.8119841748696572
" the whist party soon afterwards breaking up , the players gathered round the other table , and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs philips 	2.9224083935867107
we have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine 	2.467602157145728
but depend upon it i will carry my point 	2.801525463664209
her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice 	2.5482922703674573
for that will have more weight in the argument , miss bennet , than you may be aware of 	2.6656605764251515
they stood for some time without speaking a word 	2.7246645153628446
he bore it however with admirable calmness 	2.8800173180512068
during dinner , mr bennet scarcely spoke at all 	3.013755927332858
i must have employment and society 	3.0527569682112397
" your ' s sincerely , &c 	2.879196630939831
" well girls , " said she , as soon as they were left to themselves , " what say you to the day ? i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , i assure you 	2.648369698946421
though when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while 	2.823380560601558
" his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen , on his returning to netherfield 	2.4746304677472697
and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love 	2.5419523108786337
" but what is to be done about pemberley ? " cried mrs gardiner 	3.1765396165022954
" why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , " said she , " did he come at all ? " she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure 	2.611603672837988
it was not in her nature , however , to increase her vexations , by dwelling on them 	3.28096970870864
elizabeth looked expressively at lydia 	3.476264425960771
" " is that his design in settling here ? " " design ! nonsense , how can you talk so ! but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes 	2.913791146359849
and mr collins was to attend them , at the request of mr bennet , who was most anxious to get rid of him , and have his library to himself 	3.24084601913538
well , how pleased i am ! and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now 	2.784510815981501
" " very well 	3.2995961917171757
and they pursued the accustomed circuit 	4.404012103565974
" " i have been making the tour of the park , " he replied , " as i generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage 	2.4469387694283338
conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible 	2.9005180792569085
i hope we may often meet again 	2.9598697953619224
but who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ! " " i am the less surprised at what has happened , " replied sir william , " from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire 	2.2862306821050002
i perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been 	2.57506300018172
it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of 	2.967058042768224
there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed 	2.3087314652058297

you may use this ebook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works , reports , performances and research 	2.497763436699731
they repulsed every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation , and by so doing , threw a languor over the whole party , which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins , who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment , and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests 	2.8099786845085752
their first subject was her sister 	3.005485181997502
" who can it be ? " " some acquaintance or other , my dear , i suppose 	3.8553601419896286

and though , in comparing them , she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam ' s manners , she believed he might have the best informed mind 	3.0957572289420225
she expressed her gratitude again , but it was too painful a subject to each , to be dwelt on farther 	2.8575008114056555
he is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane 	2.8542015085892736
but his sisters gave it their hearty assent , and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend ' s vulgar relations 	3.9901261714729435

and , after half an hour ' s quiet reflection in her own room , she was able to join the others with tolerable composure 	2.6894943505260374
if he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go 	2.8102740105240374
she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity , nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct 	2.501739862220774

our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered 	3.2769386806594243
his belief of her sister ' s insensibility , she instantly resolved to be false , and his account of the real , the worst objections to the match , made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice 	2.4848460231949825
his fear of her , has always operated , i know , when they were together 	3.736311524979269

my affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever 	2.674242357003409
as all conversation was thereby at an end , elizabeth soon afterwards left the room 	2.551503062111887
and fearful of its being mr darcy , she was directly retreating 	3.998831148569867
they are certainly not gone to scotland 	2.7058541140752657
" " mary and kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , i am sure , but i did not think it right for either of them 	2.7894399662520932
" how good it was in you , my dear mr bennet ! but i knew i should persuade you at last 	2.81138088704346
oh ! why is not every body as happy ? " elizabeth ' s congratulations were given with a sincerity , a warmth , a delight , which words could but poorly express 	2.233303218211245
were it known to the rest of my family , i should not have merely my own gratitude to express 	2.996371311926231
" " certainly not 	3.249333275963587
" the party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other 	2.222170762678886
elizabeth was glad of it 	3.067555105383954
" she then ran gaily off , rejoicing as she rambled about , in the hope of being at home again in a day or two 	2.6816445106915663

mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room 	2.6008474318537935
their visitors staid with them above half an hour , and when they arose to depart , mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner , and miss bennet , to dinner at pemberley , before they left the country 	2.742561591236218
their father then went to the library to write , and the girls walked into the breakfast room 	3.3004057060466496

and at length , by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice , by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone , relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day , but had stood the test of many months suspense , and enumerating with energy all his good qualities , she did conquer her father ' s incredulity , and reconcile him to the match 	2.671952032827516
" " would you believe it , lizzy , that when he went to town last november , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! " " he made a little mistake to be sure 	2.682240489019243
elizabeth loved absurdities , but she had known sir william ' s too long 	3.5506143122855174
and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved 	2.2703804364804077
he had to be sure done much 	3.699271556449417
" " i have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two 	2.890094880267948
elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening , but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine , and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time 	2.475661864858996
his circumstances , he assured me , and i had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad 	2.946570014519833
and elizabeth saw her sister ' s countenance change as she read it , and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages 	2.8680032918414526
but she would not be secure 	3.990198884273909
that will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him 	2.4735425262966206
his father , miss bennet , the late mr darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend i ever had 	3.574795584334381
" elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend 	3.2035262022856372
" " no why should he ? if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections , because i had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? " " but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event 	2.815317674516946
" she is happy , then , " said her father , drily 	3.6502059913080873
but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter ' s being most comfortably settled , and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with 	2.7995416742005816
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth 	2.8208431811564427
" here they were interrupted by lady catherine , who called out to know what they were talking of 	2.8945919246143905
his behaviour to her sister was such , during dinner time , as shewed an admiration of her , which , though more guarded than formerly , persuaded elizabeth , that if left wholly to himself , jane ' s happiness , and his own , would be speedily secured 	2.976795520086627
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage 	2.8443491440893105
" " but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? " " it does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , " replied elizabeth , with tears in her eyes , " that a sister ' s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt 	2.6846298757486737
but he eluded the skill of them all 	5.068934672188546
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister ' s infamous elopement 	2.783814752281848
here you are in your own family 	3.15163200993613
it was a rational scheme to be sure ! but from what the report of their engagement could originate , elizabeth was at a loss to imagine 	2.4382120274490457
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly 	3.232410458645677
yet he knew to the contrary himself 	2.9300330306792266
and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you 	2.5485597640226536
but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters 	2.577098594294311
it was in the times and the courier , i know 	4.938598555100031
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs , under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants , and heedless of the future , must be very insufficient to their support 	2.7394045892283385
he is perfectly amiable 	3.9749732484763243
but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature , as the compliment deserved 	2.8847552255517175
" do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? i cannot quite agree with you there 	2.7770882478447962
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure 	2.5775899657677903
her heart was divided between concern for her sister , and resentment against all the others 	2.9632802995071517
colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time , but mr darcy they had only seen at church 	2.6566411766555516
" on reaching the spacious lobby above , they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room , lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below 	2.3759537571062865
and till the evening after the visit was paid , she had no knowledge of it 	2.9166927404191725
their table was superlatively stupid 	3.1724485616413327
let us hope for better things 	2.7770526636433304
have you seen any pleasant men ? have you had any flirting ? i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back 	2.605741572287921
" " how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it ! but i wonder how long you would have gone on , if you had been left to yourself 	2.854296129945747
and jane , who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience , from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit , was delighted at her entrance 	2.1855730208161175
the families who had been in town for the winter came back again , and summer finery and summer engagements arose 	2.6826918625605254
what is your own opinion ? " " that it ought not to be attempted 	3.896948197730426
there is nothing marked in its lines 	2.7620720277964756
when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer , i made a point of her having two men servants go with her 	2.1324035245954036
" " yes 	2.6895785044543086
she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him , and turned away with a degree of ill humour , which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley , whose blind partiality provoked her 	2.7509044564059906
" " and can you likewise declare , that there is no foundation for it ? " " i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship 	2.50290093828633
bingley , she had likewise seen for an instant , and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed 	2.4995662182181198
and affectionately taking her hand , said in reply , " do not make yourself uneasy , my love 	2.5743312206486517
mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield , which was fixed for the following tuesday 	2.5126122033598737
you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty 	2.4707642302744945
that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr bingley and jane , she had never doubted 	3.387996648010824
but at length , by elizabeth ' s persuasion , he was prevailed on to overlook the offence , and seek a reconciliation 	3.176792915153741
even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather , which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham 	2.6048194945699574
" this is a parade , " cried he , " which does one good 	4.633694227910834
anxious and uneasy , the period which passed in the drawing room , before the gentlemen came , was wearisome and dull to a degree , that almost made her uncivil 	2.2946078632498557
" kitty , who took all these threats in a serious light , began to cry 	2.6095923771802294
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense 	2.4646459565325265
and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room , its aspect and its furniture , he addressed himself particularly to her , as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him 	2.6545033188370084
no one but jane , she thought , could flatter herself with such an expectation 	3.114193787072633
her complexion has no brilliancy 	3.6570879608064906
jane listened with astonishment and concern 	3.0712688202743768
he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune , or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn 	2.2097607479290895
how long has she been such a favourite ? and pray when am i to wish you joy ? " " that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask 	2.521956145278766
and though mrs philips , as well as her sister , stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley ' s good humour encouraged , yet , whenever she did speak , she must be vulgar 	2.9950685411766544
only three miles 	4.031750761149355
she would not betray her trust , i suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found 	3.4382714993193653
he is come mr bingley is come 	3.346100807905259
she would not listen therefore to her daughter ' s proposal of being carried home 	2.6694421443482454
" " i know you do 	3.3587067745140615
" " very true 	3.3339351785078177
but while they were supported by their mother ' s indulgence , what chance could there be of improvement ? catherine , weak spirited , irritable , and completely under lydia ' s guidance , had been always affronted by their advice 	2.8036036898660863
as for your elizabeth ' s picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? " " it would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied 	2.838387745224501
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosing ' s park , when he put his letter into her hand ! she knew not what to think , nor how to account for it 	2.352015827322202
" without allowing herself time for consideration , and scarcely knowing what she felt , elizabeth on finishing this letter , instantly seized the other , and opening it with the utmost impatience , read as follows : it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first 	2.3867458100741947
and whether she wished or feared it most , she could scarcely determine 	2.6914737122852026
" but this was all lost upon me 	2.761070161115391
how does georgiana get on , darcy ? " mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister ' s proficiency 	2.9683264155689946
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself 	4.022829985582087
at present we have nothing to guide us 	3.082293276939209
she has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to anne ' s 	3.190924872283121
till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley , and her being the sister of jane , was enough , at a time when the expectation of one wedding , made every body eager for another , to supply the idea 	2.4069518925918447
but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister ' s refusal must have given him 	2.983167155493333
" she replied , endeavouring to recover herself 	2.9716921030906405
and then , what do you think we did ? we dressed up chamberlayne in woman ' s clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady , only think what fun ! not a soul knew of it , but col 	2.180237489556521
lord ! how i should like to be married before any of you 	3.1603505180415077
he was her dear wickham on every occasion 	2.6996628539033027
not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy ' s meditated elopement 	3.1535480044688726
when first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him 	2.8643533285961547
good girl ! it would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of miss bingley ' s pretended regard 	4.54280938565858
she shall hear my opinion 	3.2010518452845753
you know pretty well , i suppose , what has been done for the young people 	3.249787812139609
" " good god ! what is the matter ? " cried he , with more feeling than politeness 	2.576186626384206
the other is miss de bourgh 	3.3017420023510047
she longed to hear more , and was grateful to her uncle for saying , " there are very few people of whom so much can be said 	2.790219291532144
there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name 	3.0275635577931106
" " and have you answered the letter ? " said elizabeth 	2.7114652247789897
and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least 	2.830161561947403
there are few people whom i really love , and still fewer of whom i think well 	2.586503742588773
it is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which i am now complaining 	2.9167308989948935
mr wickham did not play at whist , and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia 	2.3071997997474183
and as for mr hurst , by whom elizabeth sat , he was an indolent man , who lived only to eat , drink , and play at cards , who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout , had nothing to say to her 	2.414653028848397
he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her 	2.8190792639652122
her heart did whisper , that he had done it for her 	3.4722036671276024
a clear ten thousand per annum 	2.784177584431185
" " well , then supposing them to be in london 	3.1619414143115767
at length there was nothing more to be said 	3.1962713801075395
" thursday was to be the wedding day , and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit 	3.073250404026687
" " to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you 	2.2328990016196473
you must not suspect me 	3.6617168192878853
her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield , to longbourn , and voluntarily seeking her again , was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire 	2.448831535480665
now is your time 	3.678660108968151
she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man 	2.8216732757326595
they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room 	2.704844428677135
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth , which spoke her distress at such premeditation , and her intreaty that she would not give into it 	2.96719781696069
she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire , and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister , in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter 	2.6145944669364845
but now suppose as much as you chuse 	2.949752260678186
twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! ) on this subject 	2.5267348245246217
its solace was visiting and news 	2.952418598368095
there was another reason too for her opposition 	2.7449618467140486
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening , to the exclusion of all conversation , and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour , till sir william thus began 	2.5387909024904576
a small sum could not do all this 	3.057050933130829
but her sister ' s was involved in it , as she thought he must be sensible himself 	3.5257469592015083
presuming , however , that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment , than any dislike of the proposal , and seeing in her husband , who was fond of society , a perfect willingness to accept it , she ventured to engage for her attendance , and the day after the next was fixed on 	2.4555863503072177
" elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte , as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling 	2.30844158986126
lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball 	2.709338256658043
and he and mr bennet spent the morning together , as had been agreed on 	2.6311611914332143
" said her sister 	4.182263017263827
" " my beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not 	2.5745765581689164
if it be not so , let mr darcy contradict it 	2.9223987131554416
the same anxiety to get them by themselves , was visible again in the evening 	2.560915799583657
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas 	3.249623095446948
such formidable accounts of her ladyship , and her manner of living , quite frightened maria lucas , who had been little used to company , and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings , with as much apprehension , as her father had done to his presentation at st 	2.651804042676351
she saw herself the object of attention , to tens and to scores of them at present unknown 	3.568373547335666
but neither that , nor any thing else , awakened a suspicion of the truth 	2.44369594313079
" and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , mr darcy 	3.62508742852126
as soon as they had driven from the door , elizabeth was called on by her cousin , to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings , which , for charlotte ' s sake , she made more favourable than it really was 	3.1137406835763524
pray read on 	3.737734706902501
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley 	2.656984152106433
but however insincere you may choose to be , you shall not find me so 	2.9828598107577604
and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much i may be wounding your ' s 	2.821772286096707
i do not deserve it 	3.3815678981819595
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother ' s 	3.0844140904789503
it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment 	2.3725254068596895
she complained bitterly of all this to her husband 	4.842679450260924
from their infancy , they have been intended for each other 	3.199094308338329
" " oh ! you mean jane , i suppose because he danced with her twice 	2.5925817273979503
it was an earnest , steadfast gaze , but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it , and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind 	2.9004683936147058
but the things should be ordered immediately 	2.684351434861151
i will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as i can , or , perhaps , i may defer it , till kitty runs away 	2.445436197187443
the officers will find women better worth their notice 	2.4942651897093793
about a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in london 	3.3784073725463744
what he means to do , i am sure i know not 	3.9556500059615063
and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on george wickham , who was his god son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed 	2.9577821214955353
" " will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again ? at present i have not room to do them justice 	2.350054258177792
mr wickham had received his commission before he left london , and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight 	2.8816859503843215
jane was by no means better 	3.7079240447673762
it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingley ' s being there 	2.6381436505548614
but what does he say of the living ? " " he does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only 	2.9158345554812426
" my dear , dear lizzy , i would i do congratulate you but are you certain ? forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? " " there can be no doubt of that 	2.717537421140785
there was not much in the question , nor in the preceding remark , but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning 	2.653320933031714
but to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character ! i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes 	2.5947263300273162
shall i get you one ? you are very ill 	2.7976412945659246
what an agreeable man sir william is , mr bingley is not he ? so much the man of fashion ! so genteel and so easy ! he has always something to say to every body 	2.2854748147786896
and what sort of young lady is she ? is she handsome ? " " she is a most charming young lady indeed 	2.817875659836024
mr collins was eloquent in her praise 	3.6437178415444653
it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman ' s of superior execution 	2.6174787373805057
nor was darcy ' s vindication , though grateful to her feelings , capable of consoling her for such discovery 	3.338370024286443
" " and if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice 	2.6035900110111436
and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter 	2.5395293109691757
there are a few things that you can do with most project gutenberg tm electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement 	2.299156148531183
" " it is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , cannot write ill 	2.7732359772761734
" oh ! my dear mr bennet , " as she entered the room , " we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball 	3.137923776431724
made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow ' s debts , and got him his commission ! so much the better 	2.198302231410934

their powers of conversation were considerable 	2.8848538377831825
" lizzy , " said he , " what are you doing ? are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? have not you always hated him ? " how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable , her expressions more moderate ! it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give 	2.1677856936561914
" after many pauses and many trials of other subjects , elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first , and saying , " i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley ! how can mr bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , i really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? how can they suit each other ? do you know mr bingley ? " " not at all 	2.5060088971369425
" we have dined nine times at rosings , besides drinking tea there twice ! how much i shall have to tell ! " elizabeth privately added , " and how much i shall have to conceal 	2.5681139240844244
" " what you ask , " said elizabeth , " is no sacrifice on my side 	3.0632997617136373
" " nothing is more deceitful , " said darcy , " than the appearance of humility 	3.414688251494506
but every body is to judge for themselves , and the lucases are very good sort of girls , i assure you 	2.7047305449728856
i rather wished , than believed him to be sincere 	2.8914093117692308
" " you shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful 	2.18463339721392
and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again 	2.5984806219400753
but these , i suppose , are precisely what you are without 	3.117279342860411
she was at least free from the offence of mr darcy ' s farther notice 	3.005286349116346
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton ! i owe all that i know of it , to another , not to you 	2.666038031109608
" if i had been able , " said she , " to carry my point of going to brighton , with all my family , this would not have happened 	3.2386570499525487
and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers 	2.5987819015760496
" " how hard it is in some cases to be believed ! " " and how impossible in others ! " " but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge ? " " that is a question which i hardly know how to answer 	2.6721842438115124
the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last 	2.32623077671952
as for elizabeth herself , this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia , that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter 	2.845018143215499
and she sat down directly to the instrument 	3.092838047387284
make haste , make haste 	3.420535475363374
but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour 	2.919478335347864
" he should be particularly happy at any time , &c 	2.639429616311597
his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself 	2.821379414915926
they had frequently been staying with her in town 	2.7104128453838516
or in other words , to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more 	2.575244391256555
and still different from either , was what mr bennet sent to mr collins , in reply to his last 	2.584310054040482
he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard 	2.4631810017638847
at such a time , much might have been said , and silence was very awkward 	2.7947705856062615
i did not expect it from you 	3.263534853013055
" bingley looked a little silly at this reflection , and said something of his concern , at having been prevented by business 	2.4889084419894796
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being 	2.520671141943446
indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for us to visit him , if you do not 	3.1591547789937677
and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte ' s dying an old maid 	2.3267021748360333
but georgiana would not join her 	2.842137617900263
i only hope they may have half my good luck 	2.689912243072109
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her , that she was only exceedingly shy 	3.2149879913876456
" i dare say you will find him very agreeable 	3.3161721773514388
elizabeth , as they drove along , watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation 	2.6967694212278386
i am perfectly serious in my refusal 	2.9363687832417233
each felt for the other , and of course for themselves 	4.023772112431563
i do not believe she often sees such at home 	2.532305247244797
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious , made no other reply to elizabeth ' s salutation , than a slight inclination of the head , and sat down without saying a word 	2.464648259915411
" mr gardiner did not write again , till he had received an answer from colonel forster 	2.3584948407246116
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain , but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears 	2.77254363684335
and to him she had hardly courage to speak 	3.046743158338261
you have done all this ! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule 	2.314380658702615
but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more i think than last year 	2.18037673035758
she got up , and ran out of the room 	2.7629270672048416
miss lucas called soon after breakfast , and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before 	2.6983365663111214
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount , and elizabeth silently consented 	3.5354250208744085
but in all , and in almost every line of each , there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style , and which , proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself , and kindly disposed towards every one , had been scarcely ever clouded 	2.7589626593895256
she blushed , and jane blushed 	3.471048317900934
" " no , no , nonsense , lizzy 	2.7138703244790032
elizabeth accepted their company , and the three young ladies set off together 	3.071856706211986
mrs bennet , accompanied by her two youngest girls , reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast 	2.358271124354569
" grieved shocked 	3.690440815850417
it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago 	2.537197698827245
" my dearest lizzy will , i am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley ' s regard for me 	2.8021233970144035
" " what think you of books ? " said he , smiling 	2.647372299575163
they must all go to brighton 	3.266754778828586
and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her , she dared not pronounce 	2.7142864218465763
and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible 	2.647456691058611
poor charlotte ! it was melancholy to leave her to such society ! but she had chosen it with her eyes open 	2.588937209409431
" i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that 	2.5242694290165484
my youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who i believe will soon become a part of the family 	2.517687911958527
i wish i could say , for the sake of her family , that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children , produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible , amiable , well informed woman for the rest of her life 	2.5404963167027947
what shall we do with him ? lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in bingley ' s way 	3.311162875983604
he stood by her , however , for some minutes , in silence 	3.2258216625912546
and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house , he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too 	2.348351127586819
are sufficiently known 	3.8414628493930225
i hope you have destroyed the letter 	3.582681094800036
she is grown so brown and coarse ! louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again 	2.9462580206360065
for though they could not all talk , they could all eat 	2.9105017099916783
lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew , but he had never seen any thing but affability in her 	2.711725426581243
accordingly , when she retired at night , she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place , what was the name of its proprietor , and with no little alarm , whether the family were down for the summer 	2.3746147997773823
" can you deny that you have done it ? " she repeated 	3.5273349686265205
the housekeeper came 	3.951578211530481
you know how i detest it , unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner 	2.827526233994664
his character is thereby complete 	3.3222601155817006
they were all of them warm in their admiration 	3.22407741969147
and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body 	2.8138147029816785
but , my dearest jane , you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend 	2.5038534886226764
but as no such delicacy restrained her mother , an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley , express her impatience for his arrival , or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back , she should think herself very ill used 	2.57066286456097
but i tell you what , miss lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead 	2.528238503686197
bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness , openness , ductility of his temper , though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own , and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied 	2.859899984359047
she had seen enough of bingley ' s behaviour to jane , to be convinced that she would get him at last 	3.7682401795916527
" " that would be a good scheme , " said elizabeth , " if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home 	2.919978143189278
only in different lines 	3.462281187980312
we were married , you know , at st 	3.496850170974427
one meets it every where 	3.407099397045477
when she saw him thus civil , not only to herself , but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained , and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage , the difference , the change was so great , and struck so forcibly on her mind , that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible 	2.1650228660035515
" he has made me so happy , " said she , one evening , " by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! i had not believed it possible 	2.823451275833307
but it is so strange ! " " yes that is what makes it amusing 	3.0578417954580024
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn 	3.3518413273677226
" " you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society 	2.367796670431979
the whole party before them , indeed , excited a lively attention 	2.86031438362416
when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them , and elizabeth , looking earnestly in her face , was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever 	2.7653453816856826
sir william lucas , and his daughter maria , a good humoured girl , but as empty headed as himself , had nothing to say that could be worth hearing , and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise 	2.9532649713644226
i am the happiest creature in the world 	2.9152629475202807
and now , i hope you are satisfied 	3.8130009261066795
balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters 	2.7132131069117023
" i began to be afraid you would never come back again 	2.697091135682582
and then you may say whatever you like of me 	2.5923636180917295
you will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that mr wickham ' s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be 	2.5117630156425936
the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion , and doubt as to the occasion ' s justifying her coming so far alone 	2.7668611721664473
limited warranty , disclaimer of damages except for the " right of replacement or refund " described in paragraph <num>	2.039558663457602
mrs gardiner looked at her niece , desirous of knowing how she , whom the invitation most concerned , felt disposed as to its acceptance , but elizabeth had turned away her head 	2.140510288591389
and the other , that she herself had been barbarously used by them all 	3.4197242923205766
the one missent must be first attended to 	2.978614374216479
" " and do you really know all this ? " cried mrs gardiner , whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive 	2.717073220887174
but i will no longer importune my young cousin 	2.736803201465535
" " oh ! if that is all , i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire 	2.6721301237533823
and we overtook william goulding in his curricle , so i was determined he should know it , and so i let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then i bowed and smiled like any thing 	2.8162513488757908
but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , i shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read 	2.5562835014718193
nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion 	2.4062613380021385
i send no compliments to your mother 	2.913123544054049
untamed , unabashed , wild , noisy , and fearless 	3.538774355098953
you shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness 	2.4403294435608403
nor was it under many , many minutes , that she could comprehend what she heard 	3.0019877787602143
" " it will be her turn soon to be teazed , " said miss lucas 	3.838188403082929
let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood 	2.963734168506779
james ' s , with very decent composure 	3.29623613445326
must it be so ? " " oh , lord ! yes 	3.628017014550771
miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility 	2.607139946857579
my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers 	3.0424029713323386
it is every way horrible ! " darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence 	2.663082963698704
she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire 	2.479518042970007
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county , she was a most active magistrate in her own parish , the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins 	2.4672031682305082
" this was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! " said mrs bennet , more than once , as if the credit of making it rain were all her own 	2.6790261471700045
he was very fond of them 	3.662166277912232
and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery 	2.360096714819315
but he is an ugly fellow ! i am glad he is gone 	3.196345858210433
" " i do not think we were speaking at all 	2.6597171373179624
" " that is exactly what i should have supposed of you , " said elizabeth 	2.8411138766488975
unless when some barbarous neighbour , who could not be enough detested , had given him an invitation to dinner , which he thought himself obliged to accept 	3.0364537597091243
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity , mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday 	2.317435660996642
i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere 	2.689986563537258
" * * * * * the surprise of the rest of the family , on hearing who their visitor had been , was very great 	2.696091658940241
it is impossible for me to be impartial 	2.962572910103557
she is now about miss elizabeth bennet ' s height , or rather taller 	2.748000091607107
" she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico , muslin , and cambric , and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders , had not jane , though with some difficulty , persuaded her to wait , till her father was at leisure to be consulted 	2.8556349479879217
my father , however , is partial to mr wickham 	3.891674628659313
" in this manner lady catherine talked on , till they were at the door of the carriage , when turning hastily round , she added , " i take no leave of you , miss bennet 	2.7440582427093223
and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together 	2.276909319753184
the door was thrown open , and she ran into the room 	3.0120112627012743
miss bingley offered her the carriage , and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it , when jane testified such concern in parting with her , that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present 	2.7538907216016524
and much as she had always been disposed to like him , she could not think without anger , hardly without contempt , on that easiness of temper , that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends , and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations 	2.6243103463958466
but i do not know when that will be 	3.3087374999217016
it would have spared her , she thought , one sleepless night out of two 	2.9027749428540126
i should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship 	3.0989125341406885
and so accomplished ! she plays and sings all day long 	3.2859617847733227
" " as i did the other day , " said elizabeth , with a conscious smile 	3.722851771641239
she is not acting by design 	3.708386330199179
i shall see her in january 	3.5931354818287273
as yet , she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness 	2.635719540094526
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for your approbation alone 	2.0441620598008132
the dinner too in its turn was highly admired 	2.4919866736593974
in society so superior to what she had generally known , her improvement was great 	2.56657604483008
he has not an ill natured look 	3.17874455349213
what a delightful library you have at pemberley , mr darcy ! " " it ought to be good , " he replied , " it has been the work of many generations 	3.264877330415539
jane was beyond competition her favourite child 	2.8065491793336097
colonel forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief 	2.643300667197637
" and that , " said mrs reynolds , pointing to another of the miniatures , " is my master and very like him 	2.609582796459487
it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next , and a still greater , that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again , and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits , by all that affection could do 	2.7010096471799367
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn , before she told her sister of mr darcy ' s proposals 	2.6826852793289144
" while she spoke , wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words , or to distrust their meaning 	2.3340360237115023
he seldom appeared really animated 	2.973324064589716
elizabeth was determined 	3.9798586303706793
" elizabeth quietly answered " undoubtedly 	2.6950302617312776
the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me 	2.873326124497269
but elizabeth , to satisfy her mother , went to the window she looked , she saw mr darcy with him , and sat down again by her sister 	3.2224023850566055
i do not know who is good enough for him 	2.7420553798488596
" " perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh , " said elizabeth 	2.6975323928728545
they were not the only objects of mr collins ' s admiration 	3.1328338779239995
but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement 	2.2667671486158723
i do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain 	2.741020035476169
" " i am sorry , exceedingly sorry , " replied darcy , in a tone of surprise and emotion , " that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness 	2.675679120677803
pray write instantly , and let me understand it unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary 	2.166030027792168
her face is too thin 	3.2170939783466905
" elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness 	2.3891389400883503
but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was 	2.4884670740676214
but , exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack , she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone 	2.673295032869558
your alliance will be a disgrace 	3.1579571252210616
it had been written five days ago 	2.9880846421359974
i wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind 	2.5991453315807695
" how despicably have i acted ! " she cried 	2.737402167899665
mary and kitty , thank heaven ! are quite well 	2.7483913632729005
chapter ii 	3.5528427098738913
i would go and see her , if i could have the carriage 	3.9265021504770754
why was he to be the judge ? " " you are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? " " i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend ' s inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy 	2.608095071717213
" " pray tell your sister that i long to see her 	2.5633308035496243
i felt nothing but surprise 	3.1922366667584465
and the good natured wishes for her well doing , which had proceeded before , from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton , lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances , because with such an husband , her misery was considered certain 	2.1589595298528264
i never saw such a long chin in my life 	3.285823551389915
when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? " " nay , " cried bingley , " this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning 	2.670167145655224
you know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it 	2.4873763920061838
and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either , to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley 	2.2843434982301853
" well , well , and so mr bingley is coming down , sister , " ( for mrs philips first brought her the news 	2.4853373776153442
it is impossible that he should still love me 	3.0200887483734005
and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her 	2.4731758863451625
but their astonishment was beyond their expectation 	2.9198667590826606
" " i admire the activity of your benevolence , " observed mary , " but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason 	2.733873065511171
but , unluckily for her ladyship , its effect had been exactly contrariwise 	2.497780722156779
you have employed your time much better 	2.764739662939052
" " indeed , " replied elizabeth , " i am heartily sorry for him 	3.433280457880638
and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place , that she might be farther from the door 	2.809201115634362
the gentlemen did approach 	3.7036646821734873
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane 	2.6730082660367365
chapter xv 	2.740340420276896
every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter 	3.991618829745442
be assured , my dear sir , that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove 	2.6832476743869536
its windows opening to the ground , admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house , and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn 	2.753215473643585
chapter xiii 	4.2330549088346086
" " la ! " replied kitty , " it looks just like that man that used to be with him before 	2.350879740872488
in three volumes 	3.035429261304607
but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on 	2.5466774967669212
i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me 	2.7049193492527293
they are my old friends 	3.0418410504124394
i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! " " i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love , " said darcy 	3.920752714258038
and more than commonly anxious to please , she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her 	2.1047517013320745
this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife 	2.794614357710267
limited right of replacement or refund if you discover a defect in this electronic work within <num> days of receiving it , you can receive a refund of the money ( if any ) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from 	1.981063177516568
and , though little more than sixteen , her figure was formed , and her appearance womanly and graceful 	2.7107799055684545
having resolved to do it without loss of time , as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday , and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment , he set about it in a very orderly manner , with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business 	2.5007506391519163
so , do not put yourself to inconvenience 	3.255953418805359
when mrs bennet was told of this , she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected , considering what her anxiety for his life had been before 	2.531183937855874
find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to hunsford , and i will visit her 	3.0671157796635735
the hall , the dining room , and all its furniture were examined and praised 	3.086733018875789
but do you always write such charming long letters to her , mr darcy ? " " they are generally long 	3.1558256664192443
he delighted in going to pemberley , especially when he was least expected 	2.794271543586874
how wonderfully these sort of things occur ! who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly ! i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which i am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before 	2.228042300448933
" fitzwilliam darcy 	3.8293059204981166
but at least it shews , that she was serious in the object of her journey 	3.191710256955278
the morning in bustle and shopping , and the evening at one of the theatres 	4.385632471842331
for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt , that all her friend ' s dislike would vanish , if she could suppose him to be in her power 	3.05567261120415
" " you have a very small park here , " returned lady catherine after a short silence 	2.4012666771705273
" indeed i have , sir , " was her answer 	3.2227992184044614
james ' s had made him courteous 	2.774873941812742
" how strange this is ! and for this we are to be thankful 	2.597966785488216
" " if you will thank me , " he replied , " let it be for yourself alone 	2.7807695547959677
mr collins might never make the offer , and till he did , it was useless to quarrel about him 	2.593602475757325
" you have insulted me , in every possible method 	4.268395821882162
for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained 	2.1000830289475734
and as a punishment for him , as well as a possible advantage to jane , she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcy ' s sister , as , by wickham ' s account , she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away 	2.671688353452684
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent 	2.273645267118149
and i was convinced of her affection 	3.3693339457611136
but they were now necessary , and she assured him with some confusion , of her attachment to mr darcy 	3.1520642391402727
" and taking her hand , he would have given it to mr darcy , who , though extremely surprised , was not unwilling to receive it , when she instantly drew back , and said with some discomposure to sir william , " indeed , sir , i have not the least intention of dancing 	2.97012413544593
i must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music 	3.050821051653495
and no change was visible in either , except that the loss of her favourite sister , or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business , had given something more of fretfulness than usual , to the accents of kitty 	3.025468943691406
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt , who did call on him in her return through london , and there relate her journey to longbourn , its motive , and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth 	2.5919283513405467
chapter xix 	2.740340420276896
and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over 	2.3499490632230873
a house in town ! every thing that is charming ! three daughters married ! ten thousand a year ! oh , lord ! what will become of me 	2.3073085779161984
they were forced to conclude , that he had no pleasing intelligence to send , but even of that they would have been glad to be certain 	2.8117809839077945
and jane more especially , who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself , had she been the culprit , was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure 	2.593709005086628
and he thought it an excellent one , full of eligibility and suitableness , and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part 	2.57918114385039
on distinguishing the ladies of the group , the two gentlemen came directly towards them , and began the usual civilities 	2.675473456003202
unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane ' s happiness , and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover , she could not prevent its frequently recurring 	3.5678526622699502
" but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it 	2.2846362103484785
when she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses 	2.9286361553694786
" consoled by this resolution , she was the better able to bear her husband ' s incivility 	2.8942045832681176
" then turning to mr bennet , he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon 	2.8539808481435354
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life 	2.63399913520286
chapter i 	3.5825234165940225
" but i can assure you , " she added , " that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy 	2.9330302848115077
you dare not , you cannot deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind 	3.056230830296789
" elizabeth was again deep in thought , and after a time exclaimed , " to treat in such a manner , the god son , the friend , the favourite of his father ! " she could have added , " a young man too , like you , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable " but she contented herself with " and one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as i think you said , in the closest manner ! " " we were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together 	2.4328072430713865
" " has your governess left you ? " " we never had any governess 	2.9118311052639556
and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement 	2.6517279681448453
but it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly 	3.1063440570783913
though lydia ' s short letter to mrs f 	3.290543280966545
i am happier even than jane 	2.773325686388715
the dejection was almost universal 	3.457490968428214
my visit was not long , as caroline and mrs hurst were going out 	2.5911658017048045
he was my godfather , and excessively attached to me 	3.984763771761895
though often standing within a very short distance of her , quite disengaged , he never came near enough to speak 	2.414436643812045
his apparent partiality had subsided , his attentions were over , he was the admirer of some one else 	3.010067760337382
they are not married , nor can i find there was any intention of being so 	2.509295802573387
she had dressed with more than usual care , and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart , trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening 	2.5005214399156737
every thing was too recent for gaiety , but the evening passed tranquilly away 	3.2799252974862725
" " aye , so it is , " cried her mother , " and mrs long does not come back till the day before 	2.9556491600878974
they were hopeless of remedy 	3.150385004491084
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family 	2.6147186363930075
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon , and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered 	2.861219385251632
wholly inattentive to her sister ' s feelings , lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy , calling for every one ' s congratulations , and laughing and talking with more violence than ever 	2.9564966516753906
by mrs hurst and miss bingley , they were noticed only by a curtsey 	3.3285692818181363
as for jane , her anxiety under this suspence was , of course , more painful than elizabeth ' s 	2.5865278892023182
and more than once during dinner did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth , " i am glad you are come back , lizzy 	2.8158988187742
and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin ' s affairs , and whose character she had no reason to question 	2.6589558041611387
our distress , my dear lizzy , is very great 	3.622033185258393
they were ignorant , idle , and vain 	2.703115013603743
and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances , and at first was resolved not to break it 	2.5001305544332912
" " i have no right to give my opinion , " said wickham , " as to his being agreeable or otherwise 	3.150032164004018
her answer was warmly in his favour 	2.9442327611604897
the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade , and within view of his own warehouses , could have been so well bred and agreeable 	2.568123790805382
" she could think of nothing more to say 	3.200790458214172
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings , and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise 	2.7449544020771786
and the kindness of the late mr darcy , though she had not before known its extent , agreed equally well with his own words 	2.742284773271372
" " really , mr collins , " cried elizabeth with some warmth , " you puzzle me exceedingly 	3.3940801641873373
as they walked across the lawn towards the river , elizabeth turned back to look again 	2.3837572400623546
she was roused from her seat , and her reflections , by some one ' s approach 	2.893513036711324
she dreaded seeing wickham again , and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible 	2.9956071519709067
" " i certainly have not the talent which some people possess , " said darcy , " of conversing easily with those i have never seen before 	2.8943994157459345
but she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents 	2.2799308804405305
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr philips ' s house , and then made their bows , in spite of miss lydia ' s pressing entreaties that they would come in , and even in spite of mrs philips' throwing up the parlour window , and loudly seconding the invitation 	3.3422141032639154
" elizabeth could not repress a smile at this , but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head 	2.853822569100049
i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home , and see if i can make it up any better 	2.9308447214403603
and by that means , as i told lady catherine myself one day , has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament 	2.8417578910132453
and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement , without the intention of marriage , she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey 	2.2302958583115173
he then handed her in , maria followed , and the door was on the point of being closed , when he suddenly reminded them , with some consternation , that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings 	2.867450926802223
end of vol 	3.824198769333818
their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of darcy ' s 	3.0573340552856587
" then , perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying , she added , " unhappy as the event must be for lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson 	2.111086325382669
they crossed it by a simple bridge , in character with the general air of the scene 	2.330244547206606
on both sides it was only assertion 	3.3403783382097636
if this be the case , he deserves you 	3.0537206876352068
but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together 	2.7797481599907794
through letters , whatever of good or bad was to be told , would be communicated , and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance 	2.6646663123901813
the sight of miss lucas was odious to her 	2.9083509038591977
what a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go 	2.819691960776428
" i assure you , i feel it exceedingly , " said lady catherine 	3.490570966742658
in what manner he thought of her , and whether , in defiance of every thing , she was still dear to him 	3.529137362332462
elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding 	2.8191663530030286
pray do not talk of that odious man 	2.9873023334822677
but , perhaps he could not in her mother ' s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt 	3.028820166548194
the next was in these words 	3.4418728789843405
and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage , miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth ' s person , behaviour , and dress 	2.777564867767023
" believe me , my dear miss elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections 	2.683768716000258
and i think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece ' s 	2.252606470736828
" and this , " said she , " is the end of all his friend ' s anxious circumspection ! of all his sister ' s falsehood and contrivance ! the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! " in a few minutes she was joined by bingley , whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose 	2.500593738335891
miss bingley did the same 	3.29524710951656
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night 	2.6808759701894904
" it certainly is a most iniquitous affair , " said mr bennet , " and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn 	2.8029470243444896
" " gracechurch street , monday , august <num>	2.9601507166330583
mr darcy , you cannot deny the fact 	3.6354165243922165
" did you speak from your own observation , " said she , " when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? " " from the former 	2.682594935409453
her favourite walk , and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine , was along the open grove which edged that side of the park , where there was a nice sheltered path , which no one seemed to value but herself , and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine ' s curiosity 	2.430751723530977
her uncle and aunt were all amazement 	3.1730453664275813
" and gathering her work together , she was hastening away , when elizabeth called out , " dear ma'am , do not go 	3.1315984924816367
and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother , when they were met by the butler , who said , " if you are looking for my master , ma'am , he is walking towards the little copse 	2.847283035325626
he began to wish to know more of her , and as a step towards conversing with her himself , attended to her conversation with others 	2.8810436652611586
but slyness seems the fashion 	3.0370853366179476
and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light 	2.548248679298276
nor will i be dissuaded from it 	3.072238840577533
" lizzy , " said he , " i was going to look for you 	3.5349645395572464
as for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin elizabeth 	2.4304890484964523
but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given , to remind her of her post 	2.575530372647085
if , indeed , it should be so ! but i dare not hope it 	3.582313112901749
the gentleman experienced some change of feeling 	2.7908199580756445
breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth : " my dearest lizzy , " i find myself very unwell this morning , which , i suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday 	2.5015168092637525
her power was sinking 	3.4670614148051278
it seemed like wilful ill nature , or a voluntary penance , for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away , but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her 	2.2567609895023573
" and really , upon serious consideration , i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter 	2.3957456638974204
" i have been thinking it over again , elizabeth , " said her uncle , as they drove from the town 	3.300729404059262
the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature 	2.3386653926843963
to no creature had it been revealed , where secresy was possible , except to elizabeth 	2.8383720378856965
it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day 	2.408202357743605
at length , however , his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family 	2.462456995716124
he is not at all liked in hertfordshire 	3.355432762650163
" john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us 	2.486215859934733
" " oh ! " said lydia stoutly , " i am not afraid 	3.850346437977563
" and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? " " i hope not 	3.6958871399003552
no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting 	2.4086858878613646
and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening , it could not dwell long on her spirits 	3.2628860582603547
it was not their wish to force her communication 	2.6851728394835908
he was angry 	4.0190944670920095
you are very cautious , i suppose , as to its being _ 	3.506608510116165
" " you go to brighton ! i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds ! no , kitty , i have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it 	2.458234010726863
" in essentials , i believe , he is very much what he ever was 	3.4719666446118715
we shall be at newcastle all the winter , and i dare say there will be some balls , and i will take care to get good partners for them all 	2.823448429027179
the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her 	2.522021617658017
and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding , disagreeable countenance , and being unworthy to be compared with his friend 	2.532195630153638
in <num>, the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg tm and future generations 	2.1782527214054084

at length , in a voice of forced calmness , he said , " and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting ! i might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little endeavour at civility , i am thus rejected 	2.743325119804576
" " which do you mean ? " and turning round , he looked for a moment at elizabeth , till catching her eye , he withdrew his own and coldly said , " she is tolerable 	2.551666785326951

to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures 	2.6784495725780424
he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that , i am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before 	2.8850400423772284

miss bingley saw , or suspected enough to be jealous 	2.754506397959114

hope was over , entirely over 	3.66343523234897
" " and what arts did he use to separate them ? " " he did not talk to me of his own arts , " said fitzwilliam smiling 	2.9425531137603067

she had not been many hours at home , before she found that the brighton scheme , of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn , was under frequent discussion between her parents 	2.4990989660309513
" is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year ? " " not so much as i could wish , sir 	2.8456465009231584
" let me first see how he behaves , " said she 	3.402575434840843
it was an animating subject , and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match 	2.5157191170163906
sometimes one officer , sometimes another had been her favourite , as their attentions raised them in her opinion 	2.2616450197253064

and then added , " may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mrs collins well 	2.6040958578052487
the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane 	2.8245826290259726
charlotte herself was tolerably composed 	3.1024002085445637
for i consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman 	2.6725996661151203
" " miss eliza bennet , " said miss bingley , " despises cards 	3.359822092000978
there was neither in figure nor face , any likeness between the ladies 	2.4813073452781818
but that charlotte could encourage him , seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself , and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum , and she could not help crying out , " engaged to mr collins ! my dear charlotte , impossible ! " the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story , gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach 	2.4548328493042524
but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them 	2.5896935190274384

" " all this she must possess , " added darcy , " and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading 	2.99699138962612
his friend had left him that morning for london , but was to return home in ten days time 	2.424558882512014
" " if it is designedly done , they cannot be justified 	2.9700879886803357
the day of his and lydia ' s departure soon came , and mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation , which , as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle , was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth 	2.6767582854782392

but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you 	3.1692029127259445
my feelings will not be repressed 	4.082268959353957
on that head , therefore , i shall be uniformly silent 	3.8757849505626485
" but it is wholly out of my power 	3.0421944382297723
" i admire all my three sons in law highly , " said he 	2.734146627126959
and it was not till easter day , almost a week after the gentlemen ' s arrival , that they were honoured by such an attention , and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening 	2.5760873266151467
this was one point , with regard to lydia at least , which was now to be settled , and mr bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him 	3.437539123018054
" " how i long to see her again ! i never met with anybody who delighted me so much 	2.365898015349922
wickham ' s affection for lydia , was just what elizabeth had expected to find it 	3.4748576448653425
to be sure , you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love 	2.2343881330974287
and when the party entered the assembly room , it consisted of only five altogether 	2.477591908527884
it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in 	3.0363382011249898
was it so ? " " yes 	3.890926228849081
" " you may depend upon it , madam , " said miss bingley , with cold civility , " that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us 	2.639380363015674
" " i should imagine not 	2.825287947646278
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman 	2.8205629692500787

mary was the only daughter who remained at home 	2.8570940388677
darcy , as well as elizabeth , really loved them 	3.2611436337685786
i am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings 	2.860133906444819
the suspicions which had just arisen of mr darcy and their niece , directed their observation towards each with an earnest , though guarded , enquiry 	2.1793331620554386
" " then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce mr bingley to her 	3.2946898672104963

and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time , than as she hoped that , by caroline ' s not living in the same house with her brother , she might occasionally spend a morning with her , without any danger of seeing him 	2.5914721417885676
at present i will say nothing about it 	2.5634408036612117
mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding 	3.637418611455693
my mother means well 	3.445520333561121

and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty 	2.4828408950886174
every body said how well she looked 	3.01095731364419
she had set her heart on seeing the lakes 	2.513765218563683
bingley was all grateful pleasure , and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her , after his return from london , whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time 	2.5579443577834
" " aye because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield , and he could not help answering her 	2.9019388607308567
and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement 	3.061316586560747
" elizabeth ' s spirits were so high on the occasion , that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins , she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingley ' s invitation , and if he did , whether he would think it proper to join in the evening ' s amusement 	2.9076394422350837
and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it 	2.566377556648307
and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball 	2.5327522832006286
i came to you without a doubt of my reception 	2.8884261333756625
the first week of their return was soon gone 	2.6079251634260374
" it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life 	3.0224328433279055
hear me in silence 	3.6732750576295876
" elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase , and listened with all her heart 	2.448519306814525
you could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine 	2.7186661983453564
he sat down for a few moments , and then getting up walked about the room 	2.740716591247891
but jane happened to look round , and happened to smile : it was decided 	2.2182445756755804
when a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty 	2.4258430628546117
i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies 	3.0296056488589493
said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before , and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning 	3.0072194037927544
and i find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old wickham , the late mr darcy ' s steward 	3.1201290090295957
her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house , whichever it might be , where mr darcy then was 	2.5113673326340544
" " what did you say of me , that i did not deserve ? for , though your accusations were ill founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof 	2.7643649540648725
on each side dissatisfied , though not to an equal degree , for in darcy ' s breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her , which soon procured her pardon , and directed all his anger against another 	2.5984842898387117
" but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery 	2.6633962376460585
in future , i hope we shall be always of one mind 	3.3686803506639604
you both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage 	3.2079724542594037
if it be so , if i have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable 	3.3645196526888657
as good natured , and as unaffected , though not quite so chatty 	3.3934471496425855
let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied 	2.5703029150360477
and yet , upon my honour , i believed what i said of myself to be true , and i believe it at this moment 	2.6962824312976386
" " oh , yes 	2.960172162679789
he was full of joy and attention 	2.771296186409008
it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where i assure you there are many amiable young women 	2.2509171126658405
i am prodigiously proud of him 	2.764860805196657
you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly 	3.297366917526109
* * * * * in the evening , soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library , she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him , and her agitation on seeing it was extreme 	2.798247724295909
and in her postscript it was added , that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer , she could spare them very well 	2.878627285872058
they have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression 	2.404164866635052
chapter xix 	2.740340420276896
mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet , and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body , went away 	2.6247938523516368
we will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen 	2.485581958632464
it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her 	2.41398883694467
he danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce 	2.4989668050254132
one day ' s delay she observed , would be of small importance 	2.85582059860126
do not unlink or detach or remove the full project gutenberg tm license terms from this work , or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with project gutenberg tm 	2.75989508125771
and already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping , when an answer arrived which deferred it all 	2.0094826690023853
" " care of him ! yes , i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care 	2.27548400388571
general information about project gutenberg tm electronic works 	2.866598950714084
it is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side 	2.465653793254012
and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before , was now high in her good graces 	3.1646842391321743
but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter , depended on the will of the parents 	2.4101233634417563
and elizabeth was on the point of going away again , when bingley , who as well as the other had sat down , suddenly rose , and whispering a few words to her sister , ran out of the room 	2.804870022246822
" " all young ladies accomplished ! my dear charles , what do you mean ? " " yes , all of them , i think 	3.0448013358915964
" " if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is , i shall know what to think 	2.9566766427651148
but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went , for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent 	2.1295678134607487
or allow her to hear it from any one but myself 	2.8670724118890893
" implacable resentment is a shade in a character 	3.7325972027981025
mr bennet ' s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion , and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort 	3.2395474512909543
" " you are severe on us 	2.810639196267436
she looked at his two sisters , and saw them making signs of derision at each other , and at darcy , who continued however impenetrably grave 	3.0952226888642183
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family , and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton , sometimes dirty and sometimes cold , did january and february pass away 	2.233522624936166
" he paused in hopes of an answer 	3.2232197217575327
" " miss bennet , do you know who i am ? i have not been accustomed to such language as this 	3.014273655463786
bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared , darcy was continually giving offence 	2.3209481594665187
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters , reflecting on what she had heard , and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it , when sir william lucas himself appeared , sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family 	2.6808747363994803
elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment , nor were the other ladies often absent 	2.5627807592274436
and he was obliged to walk about the room , while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences 	2.753217066120007
and now , my dear jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business ? do clear them too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody 	2.305235094959308
with many compliments to them , and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses , he unfolded the matter , to an audience not merely wondering , but incredulous 	3.0927181255275817
chapter v 	3.795770813013684
it settled the matter 	3.3315039303800322
for my part , i am inclined to believe it all mr darcy ' s , but you shall do as you chuse 	2.9636568916668105
she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse , but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other , and how formal and cold was their manner , whenever they did 	2.430618918086755
" " and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason 	2.482988300706891
she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions 	3.0317989652745143
and he was more communicative , and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him 	3.8789144032649285
i could not have parted with you , my lizzy , to any one less worthy 	3.4639585958770955
to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever 	2.425144405727131
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added , " how long did you say that he was at rosings ? " " nearly three weeks 	3.3380062413635927
but he found , in reply to this question , that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country 	2.2528591486425054
and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to , a wish of being better acquainted with them , was expressed towards the two eldest 	2.141035135348875
i know you will do him such ample justice , that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent 	2.667730125960561
" " but consider your daughters 	2.7918762192543087
it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason 	3.1025302986128107
but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well 	2.756283697173248
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart 	2.4760389020451585
since her being at lambton , she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud 	3.297811111700123
" " i never can be thankful , mr bennet , for any thing about the entail 	2.8991773953221633
" when she thought of her mother indeed , her confidence gave way a little , but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr darcy , whose pride , she was convinced , would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend ' s connections , than from their want of sense 	2.6659780533571666
" and , before she could reply , he added , " it is above eight months 	3.3604329872010528
" and then , " said she , " if that very improbable event should ever take place , i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself 	2.4892996356348807
but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all , and agreeable as he was , she did not mean to be unhappy about him 	2.941777769584932
" " your plan is a good one , " replied elizabeth , " where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married 	2.3302394644621187
they have known her much longer than they have known me 	2.741339067967688
but sir william ' s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly , and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane , who were dancing together 	2.48480554288455
you do not look well 	3.587800825463234
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun 	4.556846816633976
she was not rendered formidable by silence 	2.8038001589076678
mr wickham ' s happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer , and mr collins ' s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could 	3.04223990474583
he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever , on the occasion 	2.5548302316687304
" but elizabeth , who had not the least inclination to remain with them , laughingly answered , " no , no 	3.36367880222826

i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her 	3.228716249139606
and though , in looking forward , neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity , could be justly expected for her sister 	2.1396328056863476
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at , and it was rather too early to begin 	3.1201408380601188
the envelope contained a sheet of elegant , little , hot pressed paper , well covered with a lady ' s fair , flowing hand 	2.313573450837988
" " all ! what , all five out at once ? very odd ! and you only the second 	2.0781279108014705
how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned ! his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary 	2.4932233763438605
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room , to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself 	2.197591596422197
" when is your next ball to be , lizzy ? " " to morrow fortnight 	3.2832643149219205
your daughter elizabeth , it is presumed , will not long bear the name of bennet , after her elder sister has resigned it , and the chosen partner of her fate , may be reasonably looked up to , as one of the most illustrious personages in this land 	3.0639844278557433
" my dear madam , " he replied , " this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what i have been hoping to receive 	2.8968653227365473
" oh ! yes i understand you perfectly 	2.706383241058779
a flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation 	3.1693094145120697
" " i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object 	2.755727695801498
such was miss lucas ' s scheme 	3.3105187371656513
" " she is a very fine looking woman ! and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! for she only came , i suppose , to tell us the collinses were well 	2.21383294685435
it was rather small , but well built and convenient 	2.4092596297786963
her many attractions were again dwelt on , and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy , and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter 	2.4994189459080847
there was too much to be thought 	3.669746520438044
" " a great deal of good management , depend upon it 	2.812719436597596
i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long 	2.692632617194941
" " it is difficult indeed it is distressing 	2.6187307532782436
" yours , &c 	2.8449469956817848
" elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham 	3.2160496637606055
bingley was ready , georgiana was eager , and darcy determined , to be pleased 	2.9155920500052677
for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived 	2.589858435983075
what could be the meaning of it ? it was impossible to imagine 	3.6319486629080955
as a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me 	2.899757293665224
after discharging his conscience on that head , he proceeded to inform them , with many rapturous expressions , of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour , miss lucas , and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn , whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight 	2.4418642904422594
with respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured mr wickham , i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family 	2.977795264056631
" " ah ! you do not know what i suffer 	3.2031598203282257
" " that is the most unforgiving speech , " said elizabeth , " that i ever heard you utter 	3.0903302106823007
he will immediately comprehend what i must feel , and i rely upon his goodness 	2.895192205267671
and , if i may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses 	2.115981813104596
in the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins , she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth , but especially to the latter , of whose connections she knew the least , and who she observed to mrs collins , was a very genteel , pretty kind of girl 	2.4678779706576384
and on this account , as well as some others , found herself , when their visitors left them , capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction , though while it was passing , the enjoyment of it had been little 	2.212458290521957

even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away 	2.2890273053658863
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness , some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence , that might rescue him from the attacks of mr darcy 	2.178675444207975
" how could you begin ? " said she 	3.28763105744052
" but it must be done 	3.8341595297846656
" they are all silly and ignorant like other girls 	2.579489033204379
and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction 	2.8173514831736397
" i must ask whether you were surprised ? " said elizabeth 	2.7807642453494608
while there was an officer in meryton , they would flirt with him 	2.88030815025304
" don't keep coughing so , kitty , for heaven ' s sake ! have a little compassion on my nerves 	2.365465996730477
she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us 	3.165571646725176
on this point she was soon satisfied 	3.401148418658602
he was coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey 	2.1808505219164704
" " certainly , my dear , nobody said there were 	2.861130750199064
when dinner was over , she returned directly to jane , and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room 	3.05451872964546
" " no , nothing at all 	2.678981841314038
jane ' s temper was not desponding , and she was gradually led to hope , though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope , that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart 	2.823954526203495
" it has been a very agreeable day , " said miss bennet to elizabeth 	3.2860091557056763
when they had gained their own room , jane taking out the letter , said , " this is from caroline bingley 	3.0300676395562345
were it for nothing but his love of you , i must always have esteemed him 	2.927501712552003
" " what do you mean , hill ? we have heard nothing from town 	2.255437016066231

their father was in neither 	3.390466103452822
" " well , " said charlotte , " i wish jane success with all my heart 	3.43908366680083
and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia ' s connections , which is not likely , can i suppose her so lost to every thing ? impossible 	2.460957591355792
it is of all subjects my delight 	2.85546559628988
and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged , as by no means unpleasing , though it could not be exactly defined 	2.5037169743113896
into one house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance 	2.650442533666453
" " already arisen ! " repeated mr bennet 	2.6483688607758364
their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence 	3.34651298195332
his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do 	2.475836157658206
at present i am not in love with mr wickham 	3.811881571872384
just enough to make one good sort of man 	2.913338364909729
" they were interrupted by miss bennet , who came to fetch her mother ' s tea 	3.722300256747443
" my aunt , " she continued , " is going to morrow into that part of the town , and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street 	3.229328151775523
elizabeth silently attended her 	3.4607066694941806
and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley , that he might have been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation 	3.369608691580211
i defy even sir william lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son in law 	2.429727692664704
" well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual 	2.889656665683983
" " indeed ! " " yes the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift 	2.872994115847221
that he was really fond of jane , she doubted no more than she had ever done 	3.204761133848966
her heart had been but slightly touched , and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice , had fortune permitted it 	2.7052077803703147
on being made acquainted with the present mr darcy ' s treatment of him , she tried to remember something of that gentleman ' s reputed disposition when quite a lad , which might agree with it , and was confident at last , that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud , ill natured boy 	2.726830236242951
and i am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not 	3.4296609526706714
i am sick of them all 	3.0067192025305642
there are few people in england , i suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste 	2.363319147059067
believe her to be deceived by all means 	3.494895167590556
her pale face and impetuous manner made him start , and before he could recover himself enough to speak , she , in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia ' s situation , hastily exclaimed , " i beg your pardon , but i must leave you 	2.54488758421984
" you quite mistook mr darcy 	3.2929143048405707
he is nothing to us , you know , and i am sure i never want to see him again 	3.6607370091528644
and she asked bingley , whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present 	2.8342245552880008
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty 	2.7593619381553105
for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner 	2.761868441924821
and he scarcely opened his lips 	2.9150109144777323
" very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from that 	3.4787610673122056
an airing would do me a great deal of good , i am sure 	3.0084591827818854
he simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all 	4.352209871380649
you must learn some of my philosophy 	2.8481260693949157
i shall like it of all things 	2.8752485991968975
and on the gentlemen ' s approaching , one of the girls moved closer to her than ever , and said , in a whisper , " the men shan't come and part us , i am determined 	2.9491793717262937
" i am not a great reader , and i have pleasure in many things 	3.2726810939777913
you know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself 	3.375535743711624
the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this 	3.3142423411942747
it seems but a fortnight i declare 	2.9458760377469404
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me 	2.189173027867814
" miss bennet still looked all amazement 	2.8330075326797215
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character , in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement , she sent him language so very abusive , especially of elizabeth , that for some time all intercourse was at an end 	2.459273357850318
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory 	2.557380742176236
and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due 	2.736624364067312
a lively imagination soon settled it all 	2.8178151463007026
yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week 	3.4419632844157024
" upon this information , they instantly passed through the hall once more , and ran across the lawn after their father , who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock 	2.3301305447168046
how humiliating is this discovery ! yet , how just a humiliation ! had i been in love , i could not have been more wretchedly blind 	2.793165748517843
he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all 	3.0007957105416874
one came from her books , and the other from her toilette 	3.543290123631994
" i have not the smallest objection to explaining them , " said he , as soon as she allowed him to speak 	3.612292059832581
mr denny addressed them directly , and entreated permission to introduce his friend , mr wickham , who had returned with him the day before from town , and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps 	2.8048901525454997
my aunt told me so herself on saturday 	2.8664613702909096
and mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject , from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment 	2.7111895824378656
" " there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men 	2.6419776410740505
elizabeth soon observed , and instantly understood it 	2.616411488063885
how thankful am i , that we never let them know what has been said against him 	2.427843674064347
we want none of them 	3.410062684710599
pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us 	2.1464447810398934
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper , whether her master were really absent , but had not courage for it 	2.225979214830757
for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing 	2.9983831680192496
" " you have a house in town , i conclude ? " mr darcy bowed 	3.262185385292471
" a short pause followed this speech , and mrs hurst began again 	2.8473703090038343
" " in point of composition , " said mary , " his letter does not seem defective 	3.405525395718576
but will they make you happy ? " " have you any other objection , " said elizabeth , " than your belief of my indifference ? " " none at all 	2.841626681948023
perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me 	2.8251693561437587
his letter was soon dispatched 	3.667775013142716
but i think i may defy even your sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer 	2.9493129998144734
though she dared not depend upon the consequence , she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour 	2.3715152481891515
miss de bourgh was pale and sickly 	3.184217815026055
but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it 	2.8663174277491454
georgiana ' s reception of them was very civil 	2.816418397904071
she comes here to morrow with him 	2.754581166813321
without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony , marriage had always been her object 	2.2836599716923893
i only want to think you perfect , and you set yourself against it 	2.458993385022462
" she saw him start at this , but he said nothing , and she continued , " you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it 	2.889234872414861
" " you are uniformly charming ! " cried he , with an air of awkward gallantry 	2.8280646957683606
there is something very pompous in his style 	3.548230402198584
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man , who , in disposition and talents , would most suit her 	2.5408657074249454
you blamed me for coming ? " " no indeed 	3.881115371380551
" " but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take pemberley for a kind of model 	2.4341481874796655
his sisters declared that they were miserable 	3.3930787589528553
you must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what i say 	2.445885741691333
he took the hint , and soon began with , " this seems a very comfortable house 	2.5569294448797297
and his daughter , frightened almost out of her senses , sat on the edge of her chair , not knowing which way to look 	2.596726056645524
but of every other neglect i can believe him capable 	2.6528278761439266
" " how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year ! letters of business too ! how odious i should think them ! " " it is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours 	2.3748660766210605
and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror , mr gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power 	2.303747236815625
happy shall i be , when his stay at netherfield is over ! " " i wish i could say any thing to comfort you , " replied elizabeth 	2.806123327305381
she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation , and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery 	2.1331022330521656
and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted 	2.7613469980481344
but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody 	2.8430995851351746
" " i assure you , madam , " he replied , " that she does not need such advice 	3.0900980651448307
my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday , after my father went away 	2.569565319377009
it was spoken of again while they were at dinner , when mr collins joining in , observed , " yes , miss elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church , and i need not say you will be delighted with her 	2.8222380525496673
" " i beg your pardon 	2.441540931569225
but she had not got beyond the words " delightful , " and " charming , " when some unlucky recollections obtruded , and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her , might be mischievously construed 	2.861581342265198
fatigued as she had been by the morning ' s walk , they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance , and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance 	2.8057293198855984
our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself 	2.5525360468402654
to know that her daughter would be married was enough 	3.1582020024957
" " this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer 	3.161604706973395
" it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now 	2.6593932893228014
i knew you would be wishing me joy 	2.806909070096529
bingley and jane , however , soon allowed the others to outstrip them 	3.3341114377959187
" mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet 	3.0138129968423826
on the very last day of the regiment ' s remaining in meryton , he dined with others of the officers at longbourn 	2.7661259040949817
the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister , will prove what she felt 	2.986416837436072
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend , as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do , he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine ' s visit 	2.4201851845589735
" but i am sure it will be too much for kitty 	4.083999165546869
about the court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon 	2.2736709635450634
but was too angry with lydia , to send any message to her 	2.440061197222931
" " i can easily believe it 	2.979243025697803
" " yes , very different 	2.954991664399577
thank heaven ! he has some friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves 	2.351792263516239
" " upon my word , " said her ladyship , " you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person 	2.6100691865245893
elizabeth particularly , who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy , was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied 	2.3074741752216905
mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder , and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak , replied with an air of distant civility 	2.5995830525124553
" but mr gardiner , though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause , could not avoid recommending moderation to her , as well in her hopes as her fears 	2.94450089766669
but the emotion was short , and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued 	2.433432886063562
" she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each , and on which there could be no difference of sentiment 	2.2962601728696206
" " that is all settled 	3.0755313879004738
i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her 	2.4104200248364442
and she had barely time to express her satisfaction , and prepare for such a visitor , when bingley ' s quick step was heard on the stairs , and in a moment he entered the room 	2.798785251632741
certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as i was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man 	2.9414897775638535
she was no sooner in possession of it , than hurrying into the little copse , where she was least likely to be interrupted , she sat down on one of the benches , and prepared to be happy 	2.880743048715726
my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology 	2.469788118236622
do we ? " darcy had walked away to another part of the room 	2.61432745662974
" " if you were aware , " said elizabeth , " of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of lydia ' s unguarded and imprudent manner 	2.5635695263970955
he then sat down by her , and talked scarcely to any one else 	3.4001976706663024
be that as it may , she saw him go with regret 	2.9721624165223073
one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself 	2.5763701983280325
he wrote last week to hurry my return 	2.5277372834206737
for herself she was humbled 	3.4229059565027327
though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage 	3.5493743749643696
but when you have had time to think it all over , i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done 	3.4089697101088867
" " my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , eliza , " said charlotte 	3.1097787029590975
" i will go to meryton , " said she , " as soon as i am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister philips 	2.9699159149991976
as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them 	2.770951420269625
" " i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley ' s conduct to design , " said elizabeth 	2.8481122453173096
this , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together 	2.711510440896319
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine 	2.8804123142966684
pray , what is your age ? " " with three younger sisters grown up , " replied elizabeth smiling , " your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it 	2.8877772173965592
" i wish i could call her amiable 	2.912845813482247
names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony 	3.708987497284275
her mother ' s ungraciousness , made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth ' s mind 	2.9501951754001667
but no letter appeared , and she was completely puzzled 	3.347393091744424
" i hope , " added mrs gardiner , " that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her 	3.1502591642417945
" and then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you 	2.498452209689681
it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity 	2.762094378363889
she was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper 	3.121770400506216
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly 	2.8812161843638777
